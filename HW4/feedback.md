Learned
-

The students resported learing the following by doing the homework.
- Conveying meaning of balance and through artistic forms.
- Finding Data Structures in things around us
- It showed us how to integrate art with Data Structures"
- how to collaborate in group fruitfully
- to visualize Data Structures/Algorithmic art using turtle"
- Abstractions and analysis."
- Extracting the main concept behind each data structure and the course in general
- to reflect upon the data structures which might help in realizing new data structures from nature itself.
- to find the artistic aspects in data structures.
- to find natural elements that inspired the creation of some of the data structures.
- learnt the unique understanding and interpretation of my group members."
- build a data structure and implement it visually rather than build it as a code.
- if we look closely we can see that that data structures exist all around us. And we can see it where we least expect it
- learned how beautiful and creative a programming course could be and apart from that, I also realized that these operations/structures are not perfect but driven by experiences, storyboarding, and emotions.
- that it is very necessary to check whether a student is only learning the bookish knowledge and grasping the main topics of the course, or also enjoying the course itself.

Improvement and other feedback
-

The students had the following comments about potential improvement and other aspects of the homework.
- to display a data structure using abstract art , it is important to study about that data structure in depth.
- "- It was a more of a fun Homework.
- Art exists everywhere! Even in data structures.
- Homework's can be fun too!
- This assignment pushed us to be creative and gave us a view to look around and see how everything is inspired for the formation of data structure.
- I re-examined how the data structures could be visualized better and this helped me in even understanding potential applications for them.
- Helped us realize how commonly our day to day operations can reside with the data structures that we have learnt in this course ranging from organization of clothes, arrangement of book, placing food items in fridge etc.
- The assignment forced me to rethink all the concepts that I have gained from the course. This was also a very fun and easy assignment but was way more significant morally.
- Visual representations of factors learned in the topics of this course such as order, unity, discipline, ingenuity and perseverance. Allowed us to think outside box but within the domain of the course with an artistic approach.
- students may be asked to add some animations in it too to show data storage and transfer
- assigning same type of art to all the teams. Like, only single form of art such as either only drawing or only picture (photograph). Because some students have better resources so they can present better demonstration of their art.
- Be a little more specific in what is required.
- Can't be improved. One of the best homeworks this semester. Loved it!
- Clarify the Submission details, since they were not mentioned explicitly in the form.
- Homework was PERFECT! I loved doing assignments like these especially at the end of the semester. Hope all courses follow this kind of scheme where the last assignment just tests the creativity of the students.
- even at the beginning of the course we should have homework like this and we should be asked to make visual imagery through coding that would be much more interesting.
- it would have been helpful if the submission pattern and guidelines were clearer like they were always in all other home works.
- this work could have been done by pairs of two or even individually.
- a high-level rubric might have helped a little more in understanding what areas need to be emphasized more in the artists' depiction of a data structure.
- If for the same idea, all the team members can come up with their artistic expression
- If the art is to be on the given topic of our project.
- It was the best thing to do at the end of the course.
- It was too much open-ended. Adding guidelines and details would be helpful.
- Perhaps a longer acceptable latex file would be nice so we could give more explanation to our part.
- Released a bit earlier.
- it would have been more fun if performed art would have been allowed too.
- if we would also have assigned the task of implementing that data structure that we are representing via art would be more beneficial in getting good understanding of that data structure.
- The submission etiquette should be specified clearly.
- Even though the abstraction was enjoyable, it was a little too abstract for a DS2 assignment.
- This was the BEST Homework so far
