stains of blood aymen ansari
the sun was just about to set  a sign that it was time to head home  i could hear the birds cooing in the distance and the hollow far off groan of the occasional car passing by  as the hustle of another petulent summer day came to a close  though i was calm  my mind was a raging puddle of thoughts  and though i was awake  my eyes remained shut  i could pretend everything was fine as i lay here  cocooned within the crisp orange  brown mosaic of dead leaves  but somehow i knew in my gut  i couldn t keep up this facade for long 
i wasn t sure how i had escaped from the bad place  or how many hours i had spent amid the sprawling neem and peepal trees  but i was acutely aware of the dimming light around me  the air smelled like wet soil  wood and the colour green if one could smell it  i wanted to open my eyes but i was struck

by a stronger need to melt into the soft earth  not so much to die but to breathe with the ground that was coming alive  just as the sun was fading out  sunlight was no longer trickling through the tiny cracks within the foliage  the trees stood still like towering giants  their sombering branches twisting into melancholic shadows  watching me as i made my next move 
if there was a path  i could not see it  only the earthly swirls slowly crumbling to their death  among the scatter of leaves and my own limbs  i noticed my own hands and felt my stomach turn at the sight  the pulsing nausea rushed to my brain as i held my hands above me  only this time to examine the slick scarlet stains that trailed down my palms  i could hear my heart sinking with each passing second but i couldn t remember where the blood had come from  my memory had always been terrible but it had gotten significantly worse ever since i started the treatment  bugs zipped in and out of my ears  humming and buzzing  speaking to me in their annoying little voices 
do you remember what you did 
you sick little child 
i could scream now and no one would hear me  only the air in my lungs had dissipated into fear  as a slow paralyzing guilt gripped my body  madness was inconsequential 
   
i got up on my feet to gain some semblance of control but my thoughts were erratic and spiraling  there was no blood on my clothes  just my hands  the night was only getting darker and so the longer i was alone  the more danger i was in  of getting turned into a chew toy by some wild animal  the prospect of that lingering thought was becoming more and more favourable compared to the ravings of my mind 
but where do i go  how do i get out  how deep inside am i anyway 
i needed to calm down 
first thing s first  pockets  i had to check my pockets  what i found  however  looked utterly useless  laying everything out under a tree  a worn out folded paper  a crumpled 50 rupees note  a pen  and a tag with a number e 201 printed on it  putting everything back  i unfolded the piece of paper  only to reveal scribbles  this was getting excruciating  there was a long line ending in a circle  marked with an x  swirling towards the edge of the sheet  i flipped it over to the other side  there in the corner was a scribble   folo tree  and three curved lines crossing out the main one horizontally  what is this  i screamed at myself internally  it pained me to think because the throbbing in my head was getting worse but i had no other option than to make sense of the gibberish  so with a silent prayer i decided to wander further 
though my knees had no more strength and my mind was growing weary of all the voices inside my head  i meandered through the foliage  among the thickly clumped trees  dead leaves crunched underneath my feet  their papery remains digging further into the ground  as i dragged myself ahead

inspecting the trunks nearest to me  there seemed to be nothing that stood out at first  the manic energy that had taken over my body guided me to the other side  in the little light that remained  i noticed something odd  one of the trunks was marked with blood  i continued in the same direction to find another one  like a mysterious bread crumb trail  my anxiety was shooting through the roof at this point but i followed suit  constantly looking at the paper for direction 
 follow trees   i said to myself  softly  as the light bulb finally went off  i didn t know why i was walking towards the unknown with such tenacity  when the growing pit in my stomach was threatening to swallow me whole  it was better than staying here i suppose  i had no idea what time it was  or how long i had been walking but i could see a thin stream flowing in the distance  perhaps  i could get some rest and cleanup  i knew it was premature  but i felt as though the sheet of paper was a map that had somehow pointed me in the right direction  it was safe to assume that i was on the right path 
crouching on my knees  i decided to wash my hands and drink some water  looking at all the blood made me uneasy  i knew it wasn t mine nor was i injured  so then who s blood was it  why was it on my hands  what had i done  these questions had been weighing on me for too long but the memory seemed to evade me completely  the only way to find out would require me to get out of here first 
   
the last few hours had inevitably undone all the screws inside my head  threatening to unleash all the trauma that i had safely hidden  memories that even i was not privy to  the trail was slowly thinning  as the trees broke their formation  i could see a narrow dirt road to my left  a small wooden sign was positioned to my left  i craned my neck to see the words  hiking trail 5  margalla hills  sprawled on its side  as it finally clicked  i used to come here often with my mother  early mornings and late evenings in the bleak islamabad winters  days that i had always looked forward to were now a distant silhoutte from the past  i wanted to see her again  hear her voice  smell her dupatta  but the sinking feeling in my heart was a sign  i knew i could never go back 
i could hear the low rumbling sound of cars passing by just across from here  with one sweeping glance around the clearing  i disappeared ahead of the path  leaving no trace behind  except for the bloodied trees and the remainder of my sanity 
i continued to walk along the side of the road  my legs were becoming numb as i felt needles poking and prickling at my flesh  the yellow street lights were at once  a source of guidance and a reminder of my vulnerability  i had no idea how to get to my apartment from here  but it was the only place i remembered anymore and finally feel safe  i winced as i looked at my hands  crusty bits of dried blood were still embedded deep within my nails  the stink of blood was stronger than ever  as it wafted around me  there were only a handful of cars in sight but hitching a ride  with a complete stranger felt unsafe  especially on streets that were unknown to me  i hid my hands in my pockets  put my head down and decided to keep moving  just when i noticed a bus pull up ahead of me  the conductor was rushing people in  waving and shouting all at once 
it looked like an old model with worse suspension than a homemade pram  the paintwork on the suzuki bus was as striking as one could imagine it  complete with orange flowers and a set of kohl

laiden eyes and the windscreen had only a section clear to see through  the rest was baked with dirt  but it was still my safest option right now  public buses have one rule   sit down and keep your mouth shut  which was more than enough for me  so i sat in the first seat i could find  hoping to quickly blend in to flowery brocade that was plastered on each wall  never catching anyones eye  if i could manage to look sickly so much the better   the conductor who was previously hanging dangerously from the door handle came up to take the money  handing back crinkled notes of 10s blotched with paan and pockets of coin 
i looked out of the window  as the world was passing by like a bad film  it helped that i could see very little beyond the cars that slowly crept forward from all sides  there were only a few lights on the side of the road now  as the bus hurtled on lulling me into an uneasy sleep 
my thoughts become random  crazy really  sometimes faces from last week and sometimes bizarre like a marvel movie  but never comes the face i want to see  my mother  i liked to call her mama  her face comes to me only in the deepest dreams  radiant as ever  laughing  teasing  but those were just the good memories  in so many ways  the lady sitting behind me reminded me of her  or perhaps it was my own disposition to look for familiar faces in crowds  or maybe it was just her salt and pepper hair 
   
i arrived at the apartment complex and rushed towards the backdoor entrance  i didn t have my keys but i wasn t going to wait around and risk being seen by someone 
i climbed up the flight of stairs  scrambled for a bit  and found the spare key under a plant pot  mama always kept one around in case someone got locked out  i went inside only to realize that no one was home  all the lights were off but the place looked exactly the same  the way it had been before i was sent away  just the thought of those days was enough to make my hands twitch madly  my nails were digging into my palms  more blood 
i went straight to my room  emptied my pockets  and headed into the bathroom  the plastic tag fell to a corner along with the pen and paper that had saved my life 
i placed my hands on each side of the sink  and stared at myself in the mirror  not even recognizing who i was anymore  with no answers as to why i woke up in the middle of the hiking trails  with no recollection of anything except running from the dreaded clinic 
my mind was wandering now  where was mama  why was no one home  why can t i remember anything  i could feel my insides churn as my mind seeped into a nervous darkness  nothing seemed right but i needed to focus  i turned on the faucet and started rinsing my hands  yet the stains stubbornly remained  the blood wasn t coming off  i scrubbed like a mad woman  still nothing  with quivering hands  i grabbed the bottle of surface cleaner and poured it on my palms  as i winced in pain  it was the only thing that would ease my mind  the pain was more bearable than not knowing  it was better than having no memories at all

but it didn t help  nothing seemed to help anymore  i could still see the blood as it trickled down  thick rivulets falling in an endless stream  flowing into the gullies that interrupted the tiled floor  more and more with each passing second 
i wanted to pull my skin out  throw some bleach on it  cut off my hands and remove them altogether  erase it all  i had always fantasied about cutting them right down to the bone  so severely that it would hurt to hold anything  pain was good  my mind was compelling me to do it  in this frozen state  it offered me only one solution  and perhaps there was no avoiding it  i was like a calf being herded into a truck for the slaughter house  who doesn t know where it s going but it knows what dread feels like  it reminded me of something mama would often tell me  she would describe dread as a train  one that is slowly approaching  like any good nightmare  it doesn t matter where you run because it keeps on coming just the same  as time runs out  you feel your feet getting heavier  until they are set in concrete on the tracks  but all you can do is wait to be pulverized  until you are nothing more than blood and bone fragments 
i could still feel the thick liquid oozing  wet and dangling  droplets clinging to the tips of my fingers and dropping down to my body  it felt so serene  i kept my eyes closed and soaked it in until i was bathing in blood  i jumped back and slipped on the wet floor  i laid there  as the blood gushed much faster  the bathroom was getting flooded  i was drenched but i stayed still 
 it s not real   said a familiar voice  from the corner  my eyes shot up  blinking frantically to see the source of disturbance  i sat up  shaking  only to see once again the face that had stared back from the mirror a few moments ago  it was me 
 it s all a lie  it s always been a lie   she carried on  i was confused  but i nodded  i stared back at the reflection in the mirror  my body was completely clean  i had just taken an actual  normal shower  i looked down at my hands  they still had blood on them  i looked back up at her with a face of desperation  hoping somehow she could help 
 come with me   she said  turning away from me to walk outside 
 all my life i have been good  then why am i being punished like this  what s wrong with me   i was pleading with her now  my limbs felt like they were being pulled apart  one at a time 
 you know the truth  you need to stop pushing it down and accept it  her words struck me like mama s dread train  i felt something in my gut  but i wasn t sure what it was  she shook her head  as she walked towards me and held my hand 
 stop punishing yourself for something you didn t do   her eyes were kind 
 this is for us     she said  taking a deep breath  as she met my eyes 
we walked into the kitchen and flipped on the light switch  the old marbled floor was just as i had remembered  chipped and weary from when i used to run around skating inside the house  mama used to get so angry at that  and the counter that had proven to be the fatal blow  it had always been an accident  but one that i blamed myself for  until today

i remembered everything  the hospital  or as i liked to call it  the bad place and my windowless room  e 201 in the psychiatric ward   a place where time was marked by the coming of meals and medications  the hypnotic blur of the fluorescent lights that lit the hallways flashed before my eyes  as the memories of the bare walls and bleached white tiles resurfaced  and my mama  who had tripped because of a careless mistake and fallen to her death  in her home  in this very kitchen 
 but it wasn t my fault     i let out lightly  i turned towards her  she gave me a sympathetic nod and gestured towards my hands  just as the blood started to dissipate  draining away as if it were never there 
   
there was a sudden loud bang at the door  they had come for me  i looked up from my hands  searching for my spectre but she had disappeared  i had a feeling this was the last time i would be seeing her  the door came crashing down with a loud thud  as three officers stormed in and ordered me to get down on the ground  and i did  they were here to arrest me  i still had to pay for the crimes i had committed  even if it was an accident  i laid there against the cold marble floor  the very same place mama had bled out  as i watched her helplessly  but this time  i forgave myself 
my body was trembling  arms out stretched for the handcuffs that never came  these officers  it seemed were familiar with me  though i did not recognize them 
one of them smiled sheepishly   it s time to take you back to the ward  you ve caused quite a lot of trouble for us today  
this time  however  i didn t resist because i realized that i could choose to move on
