 once upon a time  there existed a small hilly pasture called varyatra on the banks of the sacred ganges river  the place was known to be haunted by a cannibal demon who took on the appearance of an aged woman  many voyagers had gone missing while exploring varyatra  old women around the fireplace at night  and young girls filling water buckets from the wells in the mornings  murmured frightful tales of how travelers had been mysteriously lured by a demon who consumes human flesh  consequently  no one dared to venture near the cursed place after sunset 
one night a young man accidentally stumbled into the lush and green pasture  while he walked into the field  he noticed the crows flying over and making loud chirpy noises  which suddenly made him anxious  the young man was holding a wood stave and bare necessities in a small red sack  he wore a plain white scarf around his bare upper body and a bright orange dhoti  his attire signified that he was a hindu pilgrim  who had been walking from temple to temple to pray for blessings and craving forgiveness for his sins from lord shiva  however  he had now lost his way  and since it was nightfall  he was unable to see anyone who could direct him or warn him of the cursed spot  he had been walking the whole day and was now starving  he was also exhausted  and shivering because of the chilly evening  for it was early winter  suddenly  the wind picked up pace and the man felt snowflakes fall over his shoulder  he shook his head and cursed himself for being caught in an awful situation like this  he was extremely anx  ious now to find a place where he could obtain a night s sleep  the man prayed silently to lord shiva to help him through the dreadful night  finally  after wandering for hours  he saw a clump of trees in the distance and through them  he noticed a ray of light from a small wooden cabin  the pilgrim exclaimed with joy 
 oh  i can surely get a night s lodging and rest my swollen limbs  
seeing the light before his eyes  the man dragged his aching body to the cabin to what looked like a dilapidated cabin  the bamboo fence surrounding it was broken  and the weed pushed its way through the ground as if indicating that it had not been maintained for ages  the glass windows were missing their bottom halves  showing the large sharp cracks on it  the walls of the cabin were also worn out  of a grotesque mahogany color and had a thick layer of algae at the bottom  he also caught a whiff of an obnoxious odor as he neared the cabin  however  the man was too distracted by his hunger and the cold weather to pay more attention  and so  he walked in as the door of the cabin was half open  and by the light of an old lantern  he could see an old lady sitting peacefully on her rocking chair and crocheting with a ball of yarn in her hands 
the pilgrim called to her across the fence and said 
 good evening to you ma am  i am a traveler of the holy ganges river and had come to pay my respects to lord shiva  but  i seem to have lost my way and do not know what to do  for i have no place to rest tonight  would you be kind enough to let me spend the night under your roof  
as soon as the woman heard herself being spoken to  she stopped crocheting and rose from her seat to approach the trespasser 
 oh my  i am dearly sorry for what had happened to you and i would be happy to help but unfortunately  due to the limited space in my abode  i will not be able to offer you a bed to sleep in  
 that does not matter    all i need is a shelter under your roof for the night  and if you will be generous enough to let me lie on the kitchen floor  i shall be very grateful for that  my

 feet are swollen  and to travel any further tonight would be excruciatingly difficult  so  i hope you will not refuse me  else i shall have to sleep out on the freezing grassland  
said the pilgrim to the women  she seemed hesitant at first  but replied
 very well young man  make yourself at home  i will bring the fire logs  for the night is chilly  
the pilgrim shined his bright smile and took off his slippers  the man looked around the tiny cabin and absorbed the warmth from his surroundings  he noticed some dull looking furniture consisting of a beige coffee table  wooden chairs  and a small fireplace at his left  at his right was a messy kitchen with pots and pans scattered over the counter  for a split second the man felt uneasy being in the new space  but before he knew it  the old woman had walked in with fire logs in her frail arms  she lit the fireplace and allowed the pilgrim to draw near it to warm himself 
 you must be hungry after your yatra  am i right  i will go and prepare some supper for you  
the man replied with a bashful nod and so the women went to the kitchen to heat up the roti and sabzi for the pilgrim 
after the pilgrim had devoured the warm meal on the kitchen floor  he thanked the lady once again and sat himself by the fireplace next to her  the pilgrim felt very lucky to have come across such a kind hearted and welcoming woman  eventually  the wood burned out and as the fire died steadily down  he started shivering just as badly as when he had arrived 
 i see you are still shivering son  i ll fetch us some more wood to warm up  you  howev  er  need to remain here and take care of the home while i am gone   said the old woman 
 no dear lady  let me leave instead  for you are old and i cannot think of putting you in any further difficulty under this chilly night   
 no  please  you must wait here for you are my guest  
she then exited the cabin  a few minutes later the woman reappeared  but this time  she looked threatening and furious  much to the man s surprise 
 you must not move from where you are  and for whatever happens  you must not look inside the back room  do i make myself clear  
she whispered menacingly 
 if you don t want me going near the backroom  then i certainly won t  ma am   promised the pilgrim  rather baffled 
the old woman then left  while the pilgrim stood alone in the empty cabin  the fire had already died out  and the dim lantern hung on the walls was the only source of light in the dark  room  the eerie silence of his surroundings soon took a menacing feel  he notice the goose  bumps rising on his arm  as he thought about the old woman s warning  as the moments crept slowly by  he started feeling a growing urge to peek inside the room at the other end of the cabin although the woman s voice was still ringing at the back of his head

 the minutes ticked by and the women had still not returned  what was hidden behind the mahogany door that the woman so wished he must not witness  the more the man thought about it  the more he wanted to find out for himself  however  his promise to her  kept him still for some time because he felt slightly ashamed  but it wasn t long before he rose from the worn  out couch and couldn t resist the temptation to peek inside the forbidden room which kept call  ing to him  soon his curiosity overtook him  despite the fear  he slowly crept towards it and ar  gued with himself 
 she won t know that i have seen inside unless i tell her  i ll just have a quick look before she arrives  
he held the doorknob with trembling fingers and felt the blood rushing to his head  making his body tense  with beads of sweat appearing near his hairline 
what he saw made his heart leap into his throat  the whole room was filled with human bones and the walls were splashed with dried blood  in one corner  the stack of human skulls rose to the ceiling  and at the other end  there was a pile of blood stained skeletons  awkwardly lumped together in a large boiling pot filled with bright red liquid  the coppery smell of the dried blood and the sickening stench made him choke  he convulsed with horror and could hardly back away a few inches from the dreadful room before falling down and for some time  he kept lying on the floor  with his body trembling and heavy breathing  his fear  however  soon made him move  with his teeth chattering and the rancid odor drenching his clothes  he forced himself to get up 
 this is horrendous  what awful deed have i done to come across this in my travels  how is it possible that this kind lady turned out to be a demon  when she arrives  she will rip me apart and stash me like the rest of the skeletons inside the room  may lord shiva help me or else i will be mutilated by the hands of this deranged woman   
while he frantically looked around the horrid room  he found two books lying at the corner of the floor  his anxiety doubled when he picked it up and read its titles  how to lure humans into your house  and  how to cook human meat   the man froze and dropped the books on the floor  he stood in shock at the stark contrast of the women s demeanor and how she truly is  immediately  everything made sense to him  the women is a cannibalistic demon and the man is her next target 
after reciting his prayers  strength came back to him  the man then snatched up his sack and stave  hurrying out of the house as fast as he possibly could  he ran into the freezing and dark night at lighting s speed  his only thought is to get as far away as possible from the demon s den  however  he had not reached far when he suddenly heard quick footsteps behind him and a voice crying 
 stop right there    stop  
the man s eyes widened at the woman s voice  that sounded inhumanly high pitched and terrifying now  he ran further into the woods  doubling his speed  and pretending not to have heard the shrieking behind him  yet  the sound of footsteps behind him kept getting closer and closer  and at last  he feared that if he turned around  he would bump into her 
 stop you  crooked man  why did you look into the forbidden room   why did you defy my orders

 the pilgrim was extremely horrified but his rush of adrenaline gave him enough power to outrun the women  fear gave him vigor  for he knew that if the demon caught him  he would be butchered mercilessly as the rest of the poor victims had been  with that  he made several prayers to lord shiva and read the durga mantra to save him 
 shanti karmani sarvatra tatha duh swapna darshane grah pidaasu chograsu maahaat  myam srinu yaanmam 
the dreadful old hag ran after him at a ferocious pace that had her hair flying in the wind  her face had now changed completely as she morphed into a demon that she was 
 stop   stop   she continued screaming 
suddenly  when the man felt he could run no more through the thick snow  he looked back at his stave and an idea occurred to him  in a split second  the man held his stave powerful  ly and turned behind  he saw the mortifying face of a demon  pitch black eyes  pale white face  large pointy horns erupting from her forehead  long black hair  all carved in a human s figure    the man stood in terror  as the demon was closing in on him at a violent speed  the man yelled and then slayed his stave right into the demon s neck  a deafening shriek erupted from the de  mon s mouth that shook the ground and momentarily awoke the flocks of birds  while the cries of the sheep and goats echoed in each corner of the land  when the man looked up at the sky  he saw the dawn breaking behind the frenzy of the birds  when he looked down  he saw the demon no more   what remained was a heap of dust on the thick white snow 
relived that the demon was dead  the pilgrim gets an idea to destroy the sinful books be  fore anyone can read it  once he reaches the grotesque space  the man picks up the books and heads towards the boiling pot to burn them down  all of a sudden  a key falls from a book  he picks it up surprised  the man opens the last book in his hand and brushes past the pages to find clues about its use  he turns to the last page and reads a bold text 
 people who are awaiting to be cooked must be stored in the storage room at the back of the house  the room must be shut at all times with this key  
the man is  once again  in awe of the women s sinister doings  but without any further ado he dashes outside the house to free the innocent captives  outside he finds a small door with a large padlock  which he the jabs the key in to unlock it  the man shivers at the sight  motion  less and exhausted women  men  and children are tied with ropes  their mouths duck taped  and they are standing in their own filth in the repulsive room while they wait to be slaughtered  a child shrieks when he sees him at the entrance and soon the others jolt awake and start making muffled noises as a sign to call for his help  one by one the man frees the captives and shows them the way back into the town  the people offer him a plethora of gratitude 
a young female spoke to the pilgrim 
 oh dear  had it not been for you  we would have never been alive  thank you for your help  please let us know how we can repay you kind man  
 there is no need  i am thankful that i have found all of you safe and sound  you can find your way back home by taking south from where the river bends a bit further up

 after he gently declines their favors  the man picks up his stave and sack to set out to travel on foot 
finally  the pilgrim was safe  he took out his japamala from his sack and bowed to make his prayers to the rising sun  he repented his sins once again and made earnest thanksgiving to god for letting him see the light of day  the man then departs on his journey  heading further north into the mystical realms of the ganges river
