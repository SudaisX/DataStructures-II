fill the void
by  sameen isfahany
you took a long time to bring me back  my friend  i was forgotten and pushed into non existence as you left behind your childhood years  letting go of my imaginary hand and grabbing hold of their real ones 
but you are twenty now and not supposed to have an imaginary friend  then why did i wake up beside you as you lie on the cold tiles of the bathroom floor  your pale face is turned towards the flickering ceiling lightbulb and your bloodshot eyes shed a few tears now and then 
 zani   i call out your name and your shoulders jerk  you slowly turn your face to look at me  your expressions bewildered 
 what the fuck did they add to this   you murmur and i follow your gaze to a half lit cigarette  or something that looks similar to one but in brown paper  tucked between your index and middle finger as you raise your hand above your head to observe it  you close your eyes  take a long drag from it and your shoulders relax as you exhale out dense smoke  your arm falling to the side again 
i m surprised  you despised even the thought of someone smoking  especially after your father had a heart attack  and yet here you are 
you seem to have changed  my friend 
you deny my presence and slowly get up  grinding the cigarette in a tin box  you strip out of your clothes  a figure of flesh and bones and small curves  and step into the cold shower  i pull the shawl around me tighter as a shiver runs up my spine and i step outside into your bedroom 
you take a long shower and when you finally get done and open the bathroom door  you freeze at the sight of me waiting on the other side 
 i i m not high wh why the fuck am i seeing someone  you re not real  
 i know   i say  you blink your eyes again and again  panic crossing your face   but do you really have to be so rude about it  
 why do you    look so    familiar  and talk like me  who are you  my hamzaad    i m mani  your imaginary friend from when you were five  remember  
you let out a small sob  stepping back and supporting yourself up with your back against the wall 
 i m losing my mind  aren t i   you stand straight back up   or this is just another one of my vivid dreams   you nod to yourself  whispering   i ll wake up soon  

it has been quite a while and you still haven t  woken up   you spent the past half an hour singing to yourself and playing the ukulele  getting frustrated at yourself for not doing it right and asking me questions in between 
 why are you back  
 i don t know  
 why are you cold  
i repeat my previous response but this time it s a lie 
 i was your only true friend   i say quietly  trying not to get upset   why did you forget me  
 i didn t   you tell me  running a hand through your short curls  you look like the  tomboy  that everyone used to call you back then   you just    started to fade away after we moved out of my childhood home  
 you replaced me with a cat   i remind you 
 the cat was real at least   you say but notice the distress on my face   but why the fuck do you seem so real  
you put the ukulele away and grab a cutter from your side table  you inspect your left arm   what    i break off as you press the blade against your skin and make a small slit 
you wince as blood oozes out and you look up at me in shock 
 i m awake  bhenchod  
you have gone back to denying my existence but i know you can see me because every once in a while  you glance up from your laptop to figure out what i m doing  i have been looking through your things  especially your writings and your bookshelf  familiarizing myself with your twenty year  old self  after a few hours  i leave your bedroom to observe your family 
your mother seems to have grown tired after these 12 years but her beauty is still visible through her eyes and smile  your father and older sister aren t around  living somewhere abroad i assume  and your brother is still a failure yet the most beloved child of the house  the center of your mother s worries 
sometime in the evening  you get out of your bed and dress up 
you inform your brother you have a gig to go to while you lie to your mother about going out for dinner with some friends 
i can t help but shiver as i sit next to you in the uber  you put your phone to your ear and pretend to talk 

 why are you coming with me  
 i think i have to go everywhere you go  
 are you sick or something  is it my mind that s sick  is that why you re freezing   you ignore as the driver throws a weird glance at you in the rearview mirror 
 i don t know   i lie  knowing exactly why i m cold  i try to push the memories down   just    just stay away from me  okay  
you take a look around at the small audience of maybe seventeen people in the room  half of which are holding their own instruments and taking turns with the sound check at the tiny stage in the front  it is an audience of artists  all gathered to perform their own piece and leave  you spot your friend sitting in the first row but you don t seem happy about it 
 what s wrong   i ask as you stand in the shadows  lightly tapping your shaky legs 
 i think i m overdressed   you say glancing at the men in their plain t shirts and leather jackets  tuning their guitars   and holding the stupidest instrument in this room  
the disappointment in your face is somewhat relieving to me because it tells me that you still yearn to be someone extraordinary  it reminds me of the time your brother was getting praised by your relatives for his paintings and you made a run to your bedroom  drew an imitation of your teddy bear   colored inside the lines  and went back to the family room to show it around  you could never stand being ignored  and part of you still desires to be celebrated  the only difference is  you ve accepted you re not good enough and rarely make an effort to stand out 
 zani   your friend breaks you out of your panic  he narrows his eyes and then smiles   achi lag rahi ho  did you practice  
you nod   i know i asked you to stay away   you say  trying to avert his gaze   but thank you for coming  aziz  nobody else even bothers anymore  
 i m here for what you love  jaani  ab jao  get your sound check done  
the only singers you seem to like are the ones who perform their original pieces and not another cover of aitebaar or creep  i can hear you screaming inside your head from anxiety but the second your name is called  it goes silent 
you start with your eyes fixed on your songbook and your voice low  i expect you to mess up  to not hit the right note or forget your key  but instead  i watch in awe as you finally raise your head  lost in the sweet momentum of your own performance and hold the gaze of a different person every time you sing a lyric 
 ae  mayus panchi ghar laut ana kabhi

geet hai jo tu likhti wo sunana tabhi pyar jaisa thi karti wo me bhula nahi 
in this moment  everyone in the room  and even out in the hall  has fallen silent  intently listening to your sad words but soothing voice  for the first time during your performance  you make eye contact with aziz and both of you simultaneously break into a smile  there is something heartbreaking yet beautiful about the way the two of you look at each other but i can t put my finger on it 
 dhundta hun tujhe yaadon ki gehrai me samjha hai tujhe raahon ki tanhai se
waada hai yahin
milenge wapis kbhi 
as the performance ends  for the first time in ten minutes  you lay eyes on me and your expressions grow frantic  aziz notices your face fall and follows your gaze  looking straight through me  you let out a small  thanks  as the eleven people left in the audience applause  you pick up your stuff and walk straight out of the room 
you and aziz make yourselves two mugs of chai at the refreshments table and sit down at the end of the dimly lit hall  facing a window wall that overlooks the city  or least part of it  the view is something i thought you only find in books   a burst of tiny red  orange and blue lights  a mess of fog softened buildings and looped roads  busy with cars and life  i have never seen such a pretty sight of the city before and even the two of you seem lost in the chaos of one of the streets until aziz breaks the silence with questions  i notice you frequently stealing glances at aziz s faint reflection in the glass  your insides warm with the sugary tea and affection for him  the muffled sound of music from the other room and the quiet talks in the back of the hall serve as a comforting background noise 
while aziz is persistent with his questions  you are curt with your replies  i learn from your conversations that you are on a gap year and unwillingly applying to universities  you have decided to keep your head low and  go through the system  
aziz offers to drop you back home but you refuse   why   he asks and i repeat the question 
you surreptitiously stick your middle finger out at me 
 i always drop you home   he says  his voice almost upset   i know you want space but  aunty will be angry if i don t safely drop you back home  zani  

 don t push it   you say and aziz frowns 
he calls you an uber and waits until you are inside to say goodbye 
when we get home and you sneak the ukulele inside your bedroom  at last you acknowledge me 
 why the fuck are you following me to places now  that s not how it used to work  you only appeared when i wanted you to but now you re like a fucking shadow  
you are starting to freak out but something tells me it is more out of fear of your own self than me 
 i don t know what s real anymore   you lock the door and sit down at the edge of the bed  trying to calm yourself   please  just go back inside my head  
i cannot go back  zani  i want to stay here  with you  and experience what it feels like to be alive 
 you re lonely and sad  and you don t have anyone to rely on   i say  trying to find excuses for my existence   you need a friend    i can be that friend as long as you want  
you stay still for several minutes  biting the skin of your lower lip  finally you let out an exasperated sigh and fall back into the bed 
 do whatever the fuck you want  
   
 monday s child is fair of face  tuesday s child is full of grace  wednesday s child is full of woe   you stopped reciting and looked up at me from the poetry book   i was born on a wednesday  
the first time you conjured me was when your mother locked you in the bathroom for throwing a tantrum  it was a frequent thing but it was night time and the only light in the bathroom was coming from the small crack under the door  you had angrily emptied out the toothpaste tube and half of your father s shaving cream in the sink and with that  your anger  and then you were just left consumed by the silence and loneliness of the tiny  damp room 

 you were so good at school that you were most neglected at home until you got your report card and sports medals  you were praised for one day  forgotten the other  you parents were always worried about your siblings who didn t do as well as you  you were a talkative child but no one had the time to listen to you so you would only speak to me about how you didn t have any friends  you thrived every day to achieve something  to be someone who had everyone s attention at all times 
you wrote your first suicide letter when you were only a kid  you weren t even aware of the concept of death or how to achieve it but you knew you didn t want to exist anymore  you told me that it hurt so much that you wanted to make your family feel guilty for all the pain  you thought your feelings  your words  on paper would have enough power to make someone realize your worth  but you were laughed at for it  you were only six 
 imagine the grammar mistakes in that letter   you say with a laugh as i remind you of the time 
sunlight creeps in through the slits between your heavy curtains but you seem to be forcing yourself to stay awake 
you turn to me curiously   what is non existence like  
 i don t remember   i lie  feeling suffocated by the memory  you nod your head as if understanding   it s just nothingness  
 sounds like bliss   you say and i choose not to argue for now 
 why doesn t aziz visit often   i ask and continue when you don t respond   he seems like a genuine friend  why do you keep your distance  
you crack a small smile  though i can tell your thoughts are hurting you 
 i don t want anyone near me when i end it  i don t want anyone to feel responsible for me  
you live like a ghost in your own home  waking up after sunset  eating whatever s left over from lunch and sitting with a stray cat at night until your mother tells you to come inside  some days your family is slightly worried  but most days they are sick of you  they don t know that you spend the nights crying until dawn  that you hide in the bathroom and smoke until you feel your insides

burn you think that is the only way to keep the spark inside you alive   that your dreams are so intense you wake up exhausted  unable to tell your dream and wake life apart  you can t stand your own reflection in the mirror or your voice anymore 
a whole week has passed and the most you have done is take a total of two showers and write a page in your journal  you taught me to play a few chords on the ukulele and i haven t been able to stop myself from playing  fascinated by the number of different melodies i can sing with it  i didn t tell you but one night when you were sleeping  your mother had barged into the bedroom when she heard me singing one of your songs  almost ready to scream at you  she was puzzled when she found the room quiet and still  and left reciting a dua under her breath  the other day your brother caught a glimpse of me as i passed by his room and he ran out to check to find me invisible again 
i ll be honest to you  my friend  i want them to find me  i want someone else besides you to notice my existence  i want to be as real as you 
   
 it s taunting me   you say  i follow your gaze to the ukulele propped up against the cupboard   it s like it wants me to play it but i m not good enough for it  
you drag yourself out of the bed and grabbing the scissors from your side table  you trudge towards the cupboard  you pick up the ukulele and 
snap  snap  snap  snap 
everything falls silent and you drop the scissors on the floor   a fucking relief  
music blares through the car speakers but is still subdued by the sound of the crashing waves  it is dark and breezy and all i can see is the orange dot from a boat in a distance and the pale moonlight  struggling to shine through the clouds  and illuminating the white foam in the midnight colored sea  there is a strange comfort in knowing that i am not the only one feeling cold as you and aziz sit there  hugging yourselves  watching harsh waves crash into the rocks and turn into foam  you seem at peace  as if too familiar with your surroundings  unbothered by the people walking past the two of you or the occasional water splashing onto you 
the sea looks so beautiful at the surface that i almost forget what it is like to be drowning in it 
 okay  i need something warm now   you say and get up  walking into aziz s car  we join you  and aziz pulls the windows halfway up as you pull two joints out of the glove box 
fifteen minutes later  the two of you are lying way back into your seats  singing along to every song that comes up  even though i find most of this ridiculous  i cannot help but envy you  for this

moment  and this moment alone  your fears seem far away from you  the dark world you always complain about does not matter  right now  your world is just aziz  a few good songs and the sea 
 i want to stay with you   i blurt out and you stop mid singing   i told you to stop following me around   you mumble   please  just promise me  
you ignore me 
 listen to me  zani   i plead with you   if you forget me again  it s going to hurt even more  i can t go back  
 so you like this  all this disappointment   you ask   to not exist and feel nothing would be a fucking blessing    
aziz sits up straight and stares at you blinkingly  wondering if you are high enough to talk to yourself 
 non existence is not nothing  zani  it s bleaker than this   you bury your face in your hands  incessantly telling me to  shut up  under your breath  i don t know how to tell you that non  existence is like drowning in this ocean  forever halfway from the bottom  surrounded by utter emptiness and loneliness  it is cold and blue very sad  sad blue   once you have lived a life  even a small part of it  you cannot go back to nothingness  i cannot go back to that never ending painful existence  
aziz lowers the volume of the stereo till it s inaudible   what s wrong  tell me  
you groan  dropping your hands and shaking your head 
 nothing  
 do you wanna talk  do you wanna go to the therapist  i know the previous one was shit but we can find a new one  
when you don t respond  aziz lightly touches your arm and i jump  i swear i can feel it  the warmth of his hand  the warmth of this person  it feels so familiar 
 i told you i ll take you whenever  or just tell me what i can do to make you happy   he says  and i get flashes of your memories   just tell me what you want  
 just tell me what you want  
you were standing only inches away from him  your eyes shying away from his worried gaze to his lips  you put your hand on the side of his face and waited for him to move away  he didn t  so you leaned in  kissing him gently  but he remained still  you leaned back 
aziz opened his eyes after a few seconds but avoided looking into yours  clenching his jaw 

 i love you   he paused   but not like you want me to  
you tried to ignore the pang in your chest  you didn t know your heart had the capacity to break even further 
 it s okay   you said exhaling a laugh   i m sorry    they re just stupid chemicals and hormones  
 i i don t want to hurt you  zani   aziz finally met your gaze  his fist was clenched and turning redder by his side   me chutya hun  i will mess up  i can t lose you too  
 you still love your ex   you said with a nod  as if finally understanding  aziz didn t say anything  his face turning red as he held himself back from screaming or maybe crying   it just hurts to be so close and not   space  that s what i need  
 bhenchod space hi space hai   aziz said flailing his arms and you both laughed realizing you are standing in an open field  he pulled you into a warm hug   you need me right now  i ll try to make you happy  i promise  
you sighed   it s too much responsibility  aziz  
 just let him take the responsibility if he wants to   i almost yell at you   zani  let him help you  but please  let me stay  
 is it the negative voice in your head again   aziz asks softly  trying to read your face   not a voice   you say  biting you lips   it s a whole fucking person  
   
 you don t feel so cold anymore   you say  touching my hand   you feel so real  mani  
halfway through the therapy session  you almost get up and walk out  but considering you had paid hefty fees for the hour  you keep talking monotonously  giving your therapist a full summary of everything you think is wrong and everything the therapists before her have pointed out is wrong with you  when you re done  the therapist gives you a pitiful smile 
 you re important   she says and you resist the urge to stab yourself with the same pen she s been taking notes with 
when you walk out after the session  you find aziz dozing off in the waiting room  jerking awake every few seconds and checking the clock  you go back inside the therapist s office 
 can i get a pen and a paper  
 how was it   aziz questions and you shrug 

 i don t know   your eyes glaze over   i feel exhausted  
 that s fine  just let me know when you want to go for the next session  
you nod  you reach out in the back of the car to grab your purse  i notice you slip something out of it and drop it onto the floor 
it is a folded paper that has  i m sorry  written on it  i feel my heart sinking 
 no  no  no  you can t do this   i scream as we get closer to your house   you can t do this to me  not after what i told you  you can t do this to yourself  
aziz stops the car near your gate  he turns to look at you as you stare at your hands 
 aziz   i call out  trying to get your friend s attention  but he is lost in his thoughts as he studies your face  looking for the right words to say to you   aziz  
 get some sleep  okay  
 don t  let her go  please  please make her stay  
you step out of the car and i follow you  grabbing hold of your arm   talk to him  tell him what you re planning to do  
you close the door behind you  avoiding aziz s smile and worried gaze that follows your every move  you unlock the gate and are about to step in but i cannot lose this fight  aziz has started the engine and is about to drive away when i walk right in front of the car 
 aziz  for fuck s sa   the slow moving car bumps into me and i fall over onto the hood as aziz pushes the brakes 
he jumps out of the car  cursing at himself 
 are you okay   he asks  looking right at me   i m sorry  i didn t see you  
you run over to us  staring wide eyed at me and then at aziz 
 you see her   you ask 
 kia  bhenchod  mari thori hai  i wasn t paying attention and almost accidently hit her   the two of us exchange glances and all you can whisper is   wake up already  
aziz has been pacing back and forth in the drawing room for the past hour  biting his nails and cursing  he pauses every few minutes to look at me and ask you questions  sometimes you respond  other times you just look right through him 
you mother comes in all smiling with two cups of chai  either she is too comfortable with your age old friendship with aziz or she wants to see the two of you get married 
 aunty  bs dou cup   aziz asks  glancing at me 

your mom is clearly confused   haan  for you and zani  is somebody else joining  
aziz shakes his head   nahi  i just thought you will join us  
your mother is delighted but leaves with an excuse  aziz finally sits down  his expressions failing to hide his panic 
 okay   he says after a long minute  relaxing back into the couch  he turns to you   what now  
you don t hear him  staring into space 
 she left a suicide note in your car   i say and aziz s head jerks to me   i don t know when she plans do it or how  but she will soon  
aziz looks at your for a long minute and then turns to me again 
 were you there with us at the gig   he asks and i nod  unsure of where here s going with it   at the beach  
 yes   i say and aziz starts biting his nails again 
 that look in her eyes    her performance was brilliant and she knew that but    she wasn t
happy  did you enjoy it  
i nod again  aziz clenches his jaw  his hands forming into fists   you were in her head all this time but now i can see you too     
 void   you say suddenly and we both turn to you  you hold the warm cup of tea in your hands but put it back on the table as you find it unappealing   mani s left a void inside me    but it s okay   you look up at aziz   save the one who wants to be saved  
 you need to leave   aziz says quietly to me  his eyes still stuck on you   you re draining her  
 what do you mean  
 she s too comfortable with you to let you go   he gets up from the couch and walks over to me  hovering above me   but the more real you and your feelings become  the weaker and unhappier she gets  
 but she was unhappy already when i got here  it s not like she ll get any better when i leave  
he nods   right  but she will be less empty  as long as she s feeling something  anything  means she is alive  even if it s a completely miserable life  there is hope for her to feel some good moments in between  
i shake my head  refusing to believe a word aziz says  i know he is right though  in the back of my mind  i have known this all along but i had been in denial  i saw the light in your eyes get dimmer as i got warmer 
 i can t  i can t  i can t  

 go back before you kill my best friend   his eyes are flaming with a mix of rage and gloom   go back or i ll fucking drag you to death myself  
 i i don t know how to   i try to explain   it s a void    in her head or her heart  i don t know  how do i go back to something intangible  
 well   aziz says  his voice firm again   now that you re tangible  your death would need to be literal  
the sea is as calming as i remember from our last visit  the waves  the breeze  the people   i will miss it all dearly 
i climb down the rocks and shudder as the cold water envelopes my feet 
 you are not real   i keep repeating aziz s words to myself 
i trudge further in to the sea until the waves start to pull me away  as dread takes over me  i am about to call out to you for help  but my voice gets stuck in my throat  i watch you smile  a little forcefully as aziz jokes with you  but i can see the light returning to your eyes  you turn your gaze towards the sea and you freeze  you struggle to get up  shouting out my name but aziz holds you down  talking into your ear 
you finally seem to let go and burst into tears 
the sea swallows me whole  the currents dragging me deeper and deeper into darkness  i lose sight of the surface  the reflection of the moonlight just a mere image in my head now 
i will fill this void for you until you call me again  my friend  but next time  i might let the void fill you
