Have you recovered from the coronavirus?

We’d like to hear from people who have tested positive for coronavirus but have since recovered. Were you admitted to hospital? 
It is estimated that around 80% of people who are infected with the coronavirus recover, without needing specific treatment. We’d like to know more about the testing and possible treatment for coronavirus, and the impact the virus has had on your social interactions and working life.
