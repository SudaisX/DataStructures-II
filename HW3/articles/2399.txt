Tell us how you have been affected by Flybe going into administration

Less than two months after the government announced a rescue deal for Europe’s largest regional airline, Flybe has collapsed into administration.
The coronavirus has had an impact on flight bookings with fewer people travelling. The airline said all flights were cancelled and told passengers not to travel to airports.
