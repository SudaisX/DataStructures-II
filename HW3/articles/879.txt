Corrections and clarifications

• In early editions of Thursday’s paper, a front-page article (Government accused of secrecy over virus spread, 5 March, page 1) was wrong to say that Public Health England (PHE) had made the decision to only release weekly information about the location of new coronavirus cases. The decision was announced by the chief medical officer for England on the Department of Health and Social Care website. In addition, the piece quoted Prof John Ashton, a former regional director of PHE, but misnamed him as Paul Ashford.
