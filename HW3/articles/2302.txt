• An agency error led us to say that a photo of Alex Salmond showed him arriving at Edinburgh’s high court for the first day of his trial. The picture was taken at Glasgow’s high court in February (‘I felt I was being hunted’ by Salmond, woman tells court, 10 March, page 16).
• Some listings in today’s Guide are out of date due to cancellations related to the coronavirus: the film A Quiet Place II is no longer out on Friday (page 5); the headline act of Drawn Lines at Sadler’s Wells has changed (page 30). For all events, please check details with venues.
