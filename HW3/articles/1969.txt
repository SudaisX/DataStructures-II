'Quarantine soirees': classical music and opera to stream at home

This page is being updated daily. Please email us (details at end) of things we have missed, or tell us in the comments section.
Operas and concerts on demand
• The Royal Opera House is making available weekly ballets or operas streamed live (and then available on demand) on their Facebook and YouTube channels. 2009’s Acis and Galatea is on 3 April, 7pm (BST) and the 2010 outing of Jonathan Miller’s Così fan tutte on 10 April. More ROH content is available on Marquee TV (see below).
• Arts and culture streaming platform Marquee TV has extended their trial period to 30 days, giving free access to a huge array of theatre and ballet productions and a large and varied collection of operas that includes most of Glyndebourne festival’s recent productions (from Brett Dean’s Hamlet to Jonathan Kent’s glorious staging of Purcell’s Fairy Queen, bonking bunnies and all). Other must-sees include Arvo Pärt’s Adam’s Passion, and Opera North’s award-winning production of Jonathan Dove’s children’s opera, Pinocchio, and one of the greatest opera events of the last decade: Aldeburgh festival’s outdoor production of Peter Grimes, staged on the beach where Britten’s opera is set. Registration (and thus credit card details) are required to activate the free trial period, but you can cancel anytime.
• The Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra has a wide array of past concerts on demand and will be adding to this page regularly. Of many wonderful concerts there, try Daniel Barenboim’s joyful performance of Beethoven’s 5th Piano Concerto under the baton of Mariss Jansons (from November 2017), or watch their celebrated and much missed Chief Conductor Jansons conducting Bruckner’s Mass No. 3 F minor.
• Opera North’s acclaimed semi-staged Ring cycle from 2016 is available on their website. Their 2017 production of Trouble in Tahiti is available via Now TV and Sky on-demand services, and, on operavision (more of which below) you can watch their production of Britten’s Turn of the Screw, captured live on 21 February 2020.
• Established opera streaming platform operavision.eu has a wonderful archive of productions from across Europe all available free. The site might be short of live operas to stream at the present time, but instead it has announced an increase in its archival offerings, with a mini Mozart festival running up to the end of March. You can also watch via their youtube channel.
• The Teatro Massimo in Palermo has several concerts and recent opera productions recorded live available to watch on demand. At time of writing the operas include Madame Butterfly, La Traviata, a Barber of Seville (check out the witty animated opening) and a Cav and a Pag. And there’s more to come, we are promised.
• The Teatro Regio in Turin has set up a youtube channel “Opera on the Sofa” and is making available past productions from the historic theatre. The opening offering is Nabucco, staged last February.
• Bavarian State Opera (Bayerische Staatsoper) might have had to cancel Monday 16 March’s orchestral concert, but few can have felt hard done by when, instead, the Munich opera house live-streamed – to an empty auditorium - a chamber music programme that included Schumann, Mozart and Beethoven and world-class performers, amongst them Christian Gehaher and Igor Levit. The concert can be watched on demand here. The opera house has also made available (until 26 March) Katie Mitchell’s Judith, a multimedia take on Bartók’s Bluebeard’s Castle and Concerto for Orchestra with Nina Stemme and John Lundgren, and a 2013 recording of Il Trovatore, starring Anja Harteros and Jonas Kaufmann (until 28 March).

• Vienna State Opera has opened its archives and is offering a different opera available to watch each day, for free, via its streaming platform.
