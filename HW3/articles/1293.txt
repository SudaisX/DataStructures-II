Corrections and clarifications

• An article about the coronavirus outbreak in Italy incorrectly stated that the latest victim died in the “town” of Cremona; this death was in the city of Crema, which is 40km from the city of Cremona. Both are in Cremona province (Italian police on patrol in towns under lockdown amid outbreak, 24 February, page 8).
• A graphic was mislabelled as showing “High-risk flood zones in England” when one of the six areas highlighted on the map was the Welsh county of Monmouthshire (20 February, page 15).
