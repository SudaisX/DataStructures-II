What coronavirus precautions are you taking?

As the number of people in the UK who got infected with the coronavirus has risen to eight and a second Brighton GP surgery has closed temporarily because of the outbreak, the risks associated with the new virus have become more concrete in Britain.
A leading health epidemiologist has claimed that the coronavirus epidemic could spread to about two-thirds of the world’s population if it cannot be controlled, and the British government has declared the virus an “imminent threat”.
We would like to hear from Guardian readers in the UK how they are responding to these warnings. Have you amended plans or altered holidays? Have you temporarily changed a part of your routine to avoid certain places? Have you started stockpiling food or medical supplies, or ordered protective face masks? Please tell us.
