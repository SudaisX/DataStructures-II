ASX closes down 6.43% after shedding $105bn

Airlines get $715m support package

Australian Red Cross needs blood donors
The Red Cross says it needs about 14,000 donors to prevent a shortage as we enter cold and flu season, and the possibility that coronavirus could cause more shortages of the regular supply from donors.
Virgin Australia to ground international fleet, cut domestic flights
The Virgin Australia CEO, Paul Scurrah, announced Virgin would ground its international fleet from the end of this month until mid-June at the earliest, and cut domestic flights by 50% in response to softening demand.
Scurrah said job losses at the airline were inevitable, but Virgin was working through it.
“What we’re working through now is how that impact can be shared, how it can lessen the long-term impact on people and we’re talking with our people directly and the unions to make sure that that impact is minimised,” he said.
“Part of what they have volunteered up is people willing to take leave without pay, people willing to go from full-time to part-time. People willing to job share and that is the incredible people we have working here.”
Churches, cinemas suspend services
In compliance with the new indoor restrictions, a number of religious organisations including the Catholic archdioscese of Melbourne and the Anglican church in Sydney announced they would suspend services until further notice. Palace Cinemas also announced its 17 cinemas would close from tomorrow in compliance with the rule.
The Sydney film and comedy festivals were also cancelled.

RBA to make a major announcement tomorrow
The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to make a monetary policy announcement on Thursday, likely around interest rates or quantitive easing, as Australia is tipped to go into recession as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
Second stimulus from federal government expected
The federal government is expected to wait for the RBA’s announcement on Thursday before announcing its second stimulus package, likely before the weekend. The package will be announced before parliament returns (at a reduced capacity) to pass both stimulus packages.
Morrison said the second stimulus would focus on the impact the strict travel and social distancing policies would have on the economy.
“The task of this next set of measures is really about trying to cushion the impact. I can’t understate the significance of the gear change that occurred last weekend. The gear change, when we were moving to far more widespread social distancing and bans on gatherings and all of this, this has a much more profound impact on the economy.”
Northern Territory announces stimulus package
The $65m package includes $10,000 for businesses for shop fitouts; another $10,000 for businesses that match that spend; $5m for immediate works; $50,000 for clubs, community organisations and not-for-profits for renovations; $30m for the return of the home investment scheme; and a suspension on government fees, charges and electricity prices until July 2021.
