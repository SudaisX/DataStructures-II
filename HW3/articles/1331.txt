Have you had an operation cancelled in the UK due to coronavirus?

To help the NHS deal with the growing epidemic of coronavirus, millions of non-urgent elective operations have been postponed from 15 April, for a period of at least three months.
Patients are to be urgently discharged in the hope that it will free up 30,000 hospital beds for those left seriously unwell with coronavirus.
If you have had an operation cancelled, we would like to hear from you.
