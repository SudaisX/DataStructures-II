From gassy passengers to viral anthems: Beijing seeks to lighten mood amid crisis

Amid the tragic news of the coronavirus spreading in China, the state-run tabloid, the Global Times, has found space for a lighter look at the increasingly complicated lives of Chinese citizens in affected coronavirus areas.
“Can’t help farting?” it asks. “Well, better try harder because infrared temperature sensors recently installed in airports and train stations to monitor temperatures of passengers amid #coronavirus outbreak can screen them all.”
The accompanying video shows infrared images of people being monitored by temperature sensors set to slapstick music, complete with farting sounds.
Their flatulence registers as red “clouds”. Even a dog is caught on camera breaking wind. One woman appears to be checking her phone, handbag on shoulder, when the sensor records a red emission.

Chinese state media has been pushing out a series positive messages over the past couple of days, including a number of patriotic videos about the country’s attempts to fight the virus.
In a statement about the meeting of the Communist party’s central committee on Monday, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, called for effective “propaganda and public opinion guidance”.
He said officials should not only publicise and report on decision making and the effectiveness of the government’s efforts but “vividly tell touching stories of frontline prevention efforts” and “tell the story of China’s fight against the epidemic and show the Chinese people’s spirit of unity”.
In that spirit, the People’s Daily on Tuesday tweeted that spring was coming and “all the melancholy and frustration will disappear under the sunlight and clear sky”.
