Corrections and clarifications

• An article about opposition to HS2 described Steve Rotheram as “Liverpool’s mayor”. As we correctly said in an article on the same page, he is the metro mayor of the Liverpool city region. His position is distinct from that of the elected mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, and the lord mayor of Liverpool, Anna Rothery (‘We don’t need it but we’ll be paying for it’, 5 February, page 23).
