Corrections and clarifications

• Our obituary of stage director Terry Hands said that he had directed Ingmar Bergman’s Scenes From a Marriage in 1988. In fact the Scenes from a Marriage that Hands directed for the RSC was an adaptation by Peter Barnes of three one-act plays by Georges Feydeau, in 1986 at the Barbican Theatre, London (5 February, page 8, Journal).
