How is your social life affected by coronavirus?

We want to know if coronavirus has affected your day to day life.
We know that lots of people have had to cancel their travel plans, but we’d like to hear about how the outbreak has impacted everyday life, from working to socialising.
Share your experiences
Tell us about the ways that coronavirus has impacted your daily life. How do you feel about public transport? Or shared spaces such as gyms? Are you finding that you or your family are more worried than usual or are carrying on as normal?
