Corrections and clarifications

• An article about social media influencers said that a report on potential TikTok earnings was done by “Morning Consult, a US tech research group working on behalf of the games company Online Casino”. All potential earnings findings came from research done directly by Online Casinos. Morning Consult did separate research, referred to in the article, on the popularity of social media influencers (New gurus, 22 February, page 14).
• Other recently amended articles include:
UK coronavirus cases rise to 19 as fears of global crisis grow
Rose McGowan: ‘I won’t be free of Harvey Weinstein until he’s dead – or I am’
Mike Bloomberg addresses US in TV ad on coronavirus and Trump response
Belgian woman dies after taking sip of MDMA-laced wine

• The correction was amended on 3 March 2020 because the UK games company referred to is Online Casinos, not Online Casino as an earlier version said.
