Pep Guardiola: it is inevitable English games will go behind closed doors

Pep Guardiola believes it inevitable that England will follow the example of Italy and Spain and begin playing football matches behind closed doors, as Manchester City’s Premier League match with Arsenal was postponed due to coronavirus fears.
Speaking before the announcement was made to call off his side’s game at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday night, the City manager said he hoped any precautionary closure of stadiums will be limited to no more than a couple of games.
“You have to ask whether it is worth playing football without the spectators,” the Manchester City manager said. “It doesn’t make any sense to play professional football without the people, because they are the ones we do it for, but obviously we are going to follow the instructions we are given.

“I would prefer not to play games without people watching, but clearly health is the most important thing, not the competition. I do think playing games behind close doors is going to happen here, but just one or two games, maybe. No longer than that.”
 The Arsenal game would have brought the return of Mikel Arteta to the Etihad Stadium after leaving his position as Guardiola’s coaching assistant to take over as manager of Arsenal in December. The pair have been in regular contact since, and Guardiola has every confidence in his former protege succeeding in north London.
“I said after one season that Mikel would make a good manager for someone, as long as the right offer came along,” Guardiola said. “He knows Arsenal very well, he played there a long time, and I’m sure they will have some success with him in charge.”

Thank you for your feedback.

The Arsenal game was the first of two City would have played before Liverpool are in action again – Guardiola’s team also face Burnley at home on Saturday while the leaders do not play until the Merseyside derby at Goodison on Monday night. With Liverpool needing six more points to secure the title, two successive City defeats would have seen them crowned without kicking a ball. The postponement of Wednesday’s fixture, and with no points available to City from that game, means Liverpool could yet end their 30-year wait without taking to the pitch.
