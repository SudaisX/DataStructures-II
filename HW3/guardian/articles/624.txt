Do you think care homes should ban visitors over the coronavirus?

Visits from friends and family of residents in care homes across the UK can continue, says the government, despite the risk of coronavirus.
Some homes have made their own decision to ban visitors but not all. If you have friends or family in a care home that hasn’t banned all visitors, we would like to hear from you – or if your loved one’s care home has banned visits, and you disagree.

Do you think care homes should restrict all visits and why? What does your loved one in the home say - do they want visits stopped? Have you asked the home to close their doors – or open them again - and what have they said? Do you think the prime minister should have announced that care homes should close their doors to all visitors in his speech yesterday or do you agree they should stay open?
