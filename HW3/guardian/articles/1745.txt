Hottest front-room seats: the best theatre and dance to watch online

I and You
Self-isolation will offer many an opportunity to binge on boxsets. But if you’re wary of committing to Game of Thrones (watching every episode non-stop would amount to three days) then try this 85-minute play starring Arya Stark herself, Maisie Williams. It’s a two-hander, also featuring Zach Wyatt, appropriately exploring isolation and also hymning the wisdom of Walt Whitman. Written by the US playwright Lauren Gunderson, the production was filmed at Hampstead theatre in 2018. It’s available for a week from 23 March.
Check Up: Our NHS at 70
Activist and comedian Mark Thomas took the temperature of our healthcare system in his urgent 2018 solo show. You can download it until 26 March if you make a donation to the Trussell Trust, which provides emergency food and support to those in need. “You know the score,” says Thomas. “It’s always those with the least who need most help especially in times of crisis.”
Snow Mouse
You have to hunt to find full theatre productions for very young audiences online so here’s a little treat: to mark World Day of Theatre for Children on 20 March the lovely Egg in Bath has released their wintry 40-minute tale for the under-fours.

The Accident Did Not Take Place
Fast-rising Manchester theatre company YESYESNONO aim to make work that explores connection in a digital world. Fittingly, they’ll be live-streaming their Edinburgh fringe show The Accident Did Not Take Place on Saturday 21 March, performed to an empty auditorium at the Bunker theatre.
The School for Wives
Travel restrictions needn’t prevent you from enjoying international theatre online. Paris’s esteemed Odéon has released its 2018 production of Molière’s satirical 1662 comedy of manners and cuckoldry. Claude Duparfait stars as the foolish Arnolphe and Stéphane Braunschweig directs. English subtitles available, évidemment.

The Show Must Go Online
The actor Robert Myles has set up a reading group for professional and amateur actors to perform Shakespeare’s complete plays in the order they’re believed to have been written. The first livestreamed reading, on YouTube, was The Two Gentleman of Verona.
Showstopper! The Improvised Musical
After more than 1,000 productions, the Showstoppers improv crew are some of the quickest wits in the biz. So it’s no surprise that when they were faced with a West End closure they live-streamed a performance. Watch their custom-made, never-to-be-repeated impro musical on Facebook.

Viral Monologues
Twenty actors performed new monologues written just for them in this new initiative, shared online on 17 March. There’s some top talent involved, including comedian David Cross, actors Rachel Dratch and Andre Royo, and writers David Lindsay-Abaire, Stephen Adly Guirgis and Monique Moses.
Peeping Tom trilogy
The brilliant Belgian dance-theatre company turned 20 this year and are best known in the UK for performing at London international mime festival and their trilogy comprising Mother, Father and Child. Their brand of domestic terror, hope and ennui will strike a chord at this troubling time: watch their first trilogy (Le Jardin, Le Salon and Le Sous Sol) online.
Since U Been Gone
Teddy Lamb was due to present a Trans Take Over at London’s Bunker theatre this month as part of its now suspended Power Share season. So they have uploaded a version of their musical fringe hit about losing loved ones and finding your own voice.
Bubble
Is this the short-term future of theatremaking? Bubble, a play set entirely on Facebook, uses a cast of European actors who never met in person, rehearsed over Skype and filmed on their cameras. Theatre Uncut release the production, written by Beats playwright Kieran Hurley, online on 23 March.

5 Soldiers
Rosie Kay’s extraordinary 5 Soldiers: The Body is the Frontline was staged in army drill halls around the UK but since its live stream is still available online you can watch it from the comfort of your own sofa. Performing in close quarters to a score that mixes punk and opera, Kay’s phenomenal company bring home the horror of combat and disarm audiences.
The Wind in the Willows
Julian Fellowes, George Stiles and Anthony Drewe teamed up to deliver a merry new version of Kenneth Grahame’s classic, staged at the London Palladium in 2017 with Rufus Hound wearing 50 shades of green as Mr Toad. It’s available to stream online for free, with the option to donate to help provide financial and emotional support to theatre workers.
Girls Like That
London’s Unicorn theatre has a world-class reputation for theatre for young audiences and its production of Evan Placey’s Girls Like That gripped the roomful of teenagers I watched it with in 2014. It’s online in full and offers a raw account of adolescent anxiety, slut-shaming and self-belief. In-your-face theatre that stays in your mind.

Le Patin Libre
Think dance on ice and you’d imagine sequins and staggering TV celebrities but the Canadian troupe Le Patin Libre has taken the artform into a new dimension. In their double bill Vertical Influences, the skaters turned the rink into a mesmerising stage slowly decorated by the patterns cut by their blades.
Woke
LIVR is a subscription service that enables you to catch up on theatre in 360-degree virtual reality. Pop your smartphone into the headset they send you and experience a range of shows including Apphia Campbell’s Fringe First award-winning show Woke, which interweaves the stories of Black Panther Assata Shakur and the 2014 Ferguson riots.

John Leguizamo’s Latin History for Morons
Self-isolation may mean that many of us will use living rooms to both teach children and watch theatre. An opportunity to combine the two can be found courtesy of the super-charismatic John Leguizamo – an inspirational tutor if ever there was – whose one-man Broadway show Latin History for Morons is on Netflix.
Cyprus Avenue
On Friday 27 March, to mark World Theatre Day, the Royal Court will release an online version of David Ireland’s blistering play Cyprus Avenue, starring Stephen Rea as a Belfast loyalist who is convinced his baby granddaughter is Gerry Adams. The film mixes the drama shot at the Royal Court with location scenes of Belfast.

Timpson: The Musical
Two households, both alike in dignity … well, sort of. Our narrator, a talking portrait, lays our scene in Victorian London and this musical comedy imagines the founding of the popular shoe repair chain as a union between two companies, the Montashoes and the Keypulets. Watch Gigglemug Theatre’s show on YouTube.
My Left Nut
This is cheating as it’s a TV series but BBC3’s superb comedy drama is based on one of the most uproarious and affecting fringe theatre shows of recent years. It’s based on Michael Patrick’s own teenage experience of a medical condition that left his testicle “so big you could play it like a bongo”. Wince.
