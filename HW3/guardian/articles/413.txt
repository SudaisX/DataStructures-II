Healthcare workers: share your experiences during the coronavirus outbreak

We would like to hear from nurses, doctors and other health care professionals about their experiences during the coronavirus outbreak.
Official guidance is regularly being updated as the virus spreads, and both the NHS and the private sector are responding to increasing demand for their services which is at or beyond capacity in many some places.
Personal protective equipment is being ordered and tested, while the government has urged manufacturing companies to produce ventilators – of which there are only 5,000 across England. Meanwhile, there are growing demands for hospital staff to be tested for coronavirus as many some are being forced to stay home due to having symptoms.
Share your experiences
What equipment is needed in surgeries, hospitals and intensive care units? How are staff being trained and protected? Are you assured by the government’s approach?
