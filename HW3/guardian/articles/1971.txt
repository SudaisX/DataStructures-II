Top concert promoters and agencies urge suspension of large music events

A group of five major concert promoters and music agencies have joined together to recommend a worldwide postponement of large live music events in March.
In response to the growing coronavirus pandemic, Live Nation, AEG, CAA, WME, Paradigm and UTA have issued a statement to offer “strategic support and unified direction” to ensure people’s safety.
“At this time, we collectively recommend large-scale events through the end of March be postponed,” the statement reads. “We continue to support that small-scale events follow guidance set by their local government officials. We feel fortunate to have the flexibility to reschedule concerts, festivals, and live events as needed, and look forward to connecting fans with all their favorite artists and live entertainment soon.”
