Comments
176 entries, with very few mistakes, mainly to do with ABORNE. Although this has no dummy entry of its own in Chambers (which tends to be a bit patchy in its treatment of such irregular forms) it should not have been too difficult to relate it to abear, where it does appear. One or two of you queried the spelling of the clue word, even to the point of suggesting that I had misspelt it myself (and in one case even insisting on cluing it as BROUHAHA). It is difficult to account for the fact that C includes it at all since not even the OED has it. One of life’s little mysteries, I guess, and not the easiest of words to clue (in either form), but most of you had a pretty good stab at it, the best being very good indeed. Despite the new PM’s diktat about avoiding its further use, Brexit still figured widely in clues submitted. Perhaps it will quietly die over the coming months, though this household at least continues to mourn the whole wretched business.
Of 16 clues nominated as clue of the month, the one receiving most votes was ‘Little in Italian court one comprehends, words being truncated’ for APOCOPATION. My reference to the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in my clue to DAIL drew a few wry comments on how the recent Irish election may affect his career. I expect he’ll continue as a member of parliament, if not a star (and he will forever remain the very pleasing anagram of AARDVARK, of course!).
There are plenty of ways to define a br(o)uhaha. One I could not accept involved omitting the hyphen from noun definitions, e.g. ‘to-do’ and ‘carry-on’, thus converting them into verbal phrases and thereby changing their meaning for the benefit of the surface reading of the clue. There is no way that BR(O)UHAHA can be seen as a verb.
And finally, in connection with the Azed 2,500 lunch in May, the splendidly diligent organisers ask me to mention that they are still taking bookings for the event. The email address for enquiries is heald.richard@googlemail.com.
