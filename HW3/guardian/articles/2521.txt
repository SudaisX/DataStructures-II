Corrections and clarifications

• An article on the latest UK poverty report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation confused two different statistics – people with a job who live in poverty, and people in poverty who live in a working family. It was the latter that reached a record high in 2018, not the former (Number of people who work but are living in poverty hits record high, 7 February, page 7).
• Wall’s Ice Cream is made by Unilever, not by Kerry Group as we said in an article about the impact of coronavirus on Chinese supplies (Jaguar boss warns car parts from China may run out in a fortnight, 19 February, page 31).
