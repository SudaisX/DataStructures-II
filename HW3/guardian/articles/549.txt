• An article about the coronavirus outbreak wrongly said a death had been confirmed in “St Helier, Jersey”. As later editions noted, that case was at St Helier hospital in the London borough of Sutton (Stock market meltdown as virus fears trigger sell-off, 10 March, page 2).
• People on zero-hours contracts can get statutory sick pay if they meet certain conditions, contrary to advice given in a feature (Holidays, pensions, events, jobs: what it means for you, 7 March, page 40).
