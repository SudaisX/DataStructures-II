Corrections and clarifications

• An article referred to an old John Lewis trial where customers were paid to have unwanted garments picked up from their home. The retailer’s current trial allows customers to return up to three items in store and receive up to £9 credit (John Lewis fits its children’s coats to become hand-me-downs, 29 February, page 17).
• We said Good at the Playhouse in London is part of the theatre’s Jamie Lloyd season. The play is in fact produced by Fictionhouse and Playful Productions (Booking now, 29 February, page 31, The Guide).
• Other recently amended articles include:
It’s like being in a science fiction film – my daily life in a locked-down Chinese city
What Bloomberg’s $500m could have bought instead
South by Southwest to go ahead despite coronavirus concerns
Beyond the beach of doom: what made Lithuania the world champions of art?
