art of fiction i  fairytales final submission
the immortal princess by  hiba nauman shaikh
they say she had been wandering the world for nearly 200 years  flitting from village to town  sleeping under bright leaves and bare branches  wearing only a plain cotton tunic and an empty scabbard  whispers and rumors followed her everywhere  she had once been a princess with a hundred dresses  a thousand servants and spirit powers to behold  powers that could grant her the gift of immortality  and yet she acted like a simple beggar  never once using her powers  never staying in one place 
as the legends go  her story began on the day of her very first grand festival 
the courtyard echoed with racing footsteps  a flurry of tunics and dresses  clothes piled high in the arms of frantic servants  heated yelling  heavy gold pitchers and carved bronze water pots being carried with a careful desperation  the fountain in the middle trickled away peacefully as chaos reigned around it 
sayen  hovering above the domed top of her bedroom tower  sitting cross legged on her perfectly conjured puff of wind  watched everything 
early morning meditation was impossible  the palace was immersed in its annual havoc for the lamp festival  with grand performances and animal sacrifices for the heavens  sayen s first one ever now that she was finally twelve  she was going to do a grand performance using her newly learned earth and wind skills  her water powers were fairly good but took up too much energy  as for fire   well  she had never been good at it  in fact  she had once burned her hands badly when she had tried it at six years old  in horrific pain and tears  she had looked up at the heavens and begged them to take the fire away  and they had  she hadn t told anyone  pretending to be too scared to use her fire again 
at least she was better than the other children  a fact she knew due to the constant scowls  the spiteful whispers  the subtle bumps and pushes she got from them  she scared them  just like she scared their parents  the nobles  the empress s council too and the ministers and the servants and her six older siblings and  if sayen was being really honest  the empress herself 
after all  how could the youngest princess  the unruly  rebellious  reckless child  be the closest to the heavens  why had the angels blessed her with all the elemental powers  the last heavens  disciple had been chosen over a millennia ago and had brought an end to the countless wars ravaging the five great empires  sayen had grown up studying the horrific battles and the heroic senghani warriors of the past  a dark history that was now merely a lesson taught to children brought up in the era of peace 
the earth people  the senghani  were finally free  what use did heavens  blessings have in these peaceful times  why was sayen born with tainted wild powers that no longer had a place in the senghan empire

 it stirred up the nobles and the princes and princesses  all the high people of the court  who had honed their powers for decades in the hopes of catching the heavens  favor and obtaining miracles  now it seemed the heavens had already singled out one 
so sayen was used to disdainful looks and snide rumors  it didn t matter  she was going to be the highlight of tonight  and with every festival  she would become stronger and then one day  strong enough to be the heavens  chosen immortal 
but without her daily meditation  who knows when that would happen  even now  the windy drafts were escaping her control and ruffling her dark wild curls into a halo around her head  with a huff  sayen caught a stray wind current with her finger  whirled it around and sent it spinning down into the flurry of people  a bundle of dresses flew out of a servant s arms  dancing across the courtyard  the servant ran after them in horror while sayen collapsed in giggles 
 that was mean  
sayen looked down  aila s head hung out of her bedroom window  her long black hair swaying as she craned her neck to look up at sayen  deep brown eyes twinkling 
sayen shrugged   the wind folk are mean and selfish and violent  aren t they  that s what the teachers say   every single teacher over the years  all of whom were silently furious at sayen s formidable wind skills and her far less impressive earth ones  a disgrace to your senghani heritage you are  sayen 
aila sighed with the weight of the two years she had over sayen   so you need to be careful  sayen  you know that  
 now you re sounding like the teachers  acting like we re still at war with the andhinese    your lessons start soon  don t they   aila smiled and ducked out 
sayen groaned then floated down and into her bedroom  landing perfectly on her feet 
aila clapped with a laugh   i can t believe your wind only manifested a year ago  you re already so good  
 i know   said sayen with a practiced nonchalance as she walked towards the door   and i m going to be perfect  you ll see  
 are you going to teach maya  
sayen paused   i can t  mama only let her in here because her spirit is so weak  please don t say it in front of her again  
aila s shoulders slumped and she looked small  despite sayen barely coming up to her shoulders  she fixed her gaze down at her feet as she followed sayen   right  sorry  
maya only came to the palace a few months ago  a dirty bedraggled little girl a year younger than sayen  with hooded grey eyes  pale skin and a bald head  unlike sayen and aila and most everyone in the senghan empire  not just an outsider  but a stray from the hated andhin empire  the palace guards would have kicked her out and the town would have trampled her before she even attempted to make her way to some remote village i the south with the remnants of the andhinese people  then sayen intervened  i need another servant  she d looked up at the empress seated in her throne  aila has too much to do  please mama 

page  3
 so yes  she had saved maya  given her respected work  shielded her from all the hostile gazes  but she couldn t teach her wind skills  her blood was tainted with the cruelty of her andhinese ancestors  she might be good and quiet and polite and hardworking and eager to please  but you are the one with the pure blood  sayen  her teacher had said  the senghans never consort with outsiders or dirty their powers with tools and weapons and tricks  you are pure 
sayen swallowed as she walked down the corridor  shafts of sunlight pouring out the arched windows  it was wrong  she knew it was wrong  maya wasn t like that 
she finally reached the study room  already full with the children of nobles sitting on the carpeted floor  her head teacher raised his eyebrows   nice of you to join us  sayen  
 i was meditating like you told me   said sayen with a grin   and look   before anyone could say anything  she ran towards a window and flung herself out 
the children screamed and rushed to the window  the three teachers yelled  sayen flew to the opposite tower  landed neatly on the roof and took a bow 
 get back here now   her head teacher s voice echoed even above the madness in the courtyard 
sayen flew back into the study room  letting a whoosh of air in with her   see   she laughed up at her teachers  the children were all huddled together on the floor  muttering and glaring at her  one little boy was crying  a girl s voice murmured   you re a freak  
sayen whirled around   say that again  
a boy stood up and stomped his foot  cracking the floor under sayen  making her stumble   freak  
sayen raised her arm and a cloud appeared above the children  sending down a shower of rain upon them  the children shrieked 
 sayen  enough  
she turned back towards her teachers  they were sitting on the dais in front of the room  the head teacher in front with the other two flanking him from behind   come here  
she skipped over to the dais and kneeled down in front of it   i don t need lessons anymore teacher  don t you see  i can do it myself  i can sit with mama in the throne room now  i can go out into the villages too  
the head teacher placed a lump of clay on the floor   mold it into a carved urn  
sayen grumbled then stretched her arm out  gathering her spirit powers from her core  feeling then flow through her veins and rush out of her fingertips  the clay shook then bits of it flew up and pieced themselves together into a tall urn  the clay deepening with delicate carvings  it was perfect  then it exploded 
 there   said the head teacher   as usual  do you see now  
 it s just a stupid urn   sayen muttered 
 it s a skill every child in the empire can do  except you  

page  4
 sayen hunched her shoulders  glaring at the broken pieces of clay 
 you have no discipline  sayen  no focus  you only know how to play tricks and fly  you think you can handle court matters  reassure the common people  be their representative  you will only scare them  you are irresponsible and out of control  
tears pushed at sayen s eyes but she blinked them back   i m strong  i m the only one who can do all four elementals in the whole empire   her voice didn t even crack at the  four    i m the strongest ever  you told me that  
 strength  on its own  is destruction  right now  sayen  you are destruction  
the whole class was silent  sayen clamped up her mouth  refusing to let out even the tiniest of whimpers 
 but   said the head teacher heavily   all is not lost  i have discussed this with your mother and we have decided   he held out his hand and the teacher behind him on his right handed him an object wrapped in silk  the head teacher held it out towards sayen   go on  
sayen stood up  head held high and took the object  letting the silk flutter to the ground  it revealed a short dagger  about a third the length of her arm  with a plain silver handle and an even plainer brown scabbard  the grand gold and silver katars that her brothers wore on their sides flashed in her mind   what   what is this  
 it will help you contain and guide your powers  our spirit cores are wild and instinctual and it is only discipline  dedication and skill that controls them  despite all your training and the profuse efforts spent towards you  you have failed  clearly you need a physical vessel that can channel your energy  hence  the weapon  it is an ancient and barbaric method of course but    
the words faded for sayen as she looked at the blade  her dark brown skin paling  trying to ignore the sneers and snickers behind her  her hand shook  knuckles white as they gripped the handle  you are pure  those words were fading away too  you are pure 
the lessons eventually ended and sayen ran up the winding staircase to her bedroom  finding aila and maya sitting in the balcony  maya was studiously mending a rip in sayen s night dress while aila was chattering away  they stopped and looked up at an out of breath sayen  her long dark curls wilder than usual 
the whole sorry story was told  aila s eyes wide with sympathy  maya staring at the dress and needle in her hands   what do i do now   sayen choked out  still refusing to let the tears escape   everyone will hate me  i just wanted to be strong  to be the chosen immortal  to be a good ruler  to help people  what do i do  
aila gripped her hands  murmuring assurances  maya looked up   you re going to do your performance tonight  you ll master your weapon  then the heavens will choose you  
 but how  i m not     sayen stopped  i m not pure anymore  she looked at the bag hanging on maya s shoulder containing the knives she always carried with her  to channel her meagre powers 
maya shrugged   you have all four elementals   sayen swallowed hard but didn t turn her head away   of course they ll choose you  then you ll fight for the common people right  that s what you told us  

page  5 sayen nodded  she knew who maya meant  the remote southern villages on the outskirts of
the empire that maya secretly visited  the villages the rest of the empire would prefer not exist 
 but no one will help me   sayen said  her head down   people in the palace already hate me  and now    
 people always hate what they don t understand   maya shrugged   you just got to go on  
there was a bitter tinge to her voice  sayen looked up  maya smiled at her then nodded to the dagger still gripped tightly in sayen s hand   want me to teach you  
   
eight years later
the earth rumbled  loose pebbles skittering on the ground  then a groaning sound and an enormous rock punched out of the land  growing upwards  shaped like a giant fist  sayen grinned and raised her own arm to the sky  the dagger clutched in her fist gleaming in the sun  watch me  she thought  watch me  heavens  and choose me 
the training grounds were silent  despite all the hundreds of students gathered in the stands  the three teachers standing in the circle in the middle with sayen and the biggest rock formation any student had been able to make  and silence  sayen lowered her hand  her face blank  don t let them see  she turned to her teachers   well  
the head teacher nodded   that was quite impressive  sayen  you are indeed ready for your twentieth year lamp festival   he turned to the stands   now  who s next  
gritting her teeth  sayen flung out her arm  spun it in a circle and let her dagger create a mini whirlwind   guess i m not needed anymore   she ran and jumped into the whirlwind  ignoring her teachers  exasperated yells and rode towards the town  weaving through the streets  dodging fancy carriages  donkey pulled carts  and stunned people  making sure no strand of wind strayed away  it was the fastest and calmest whirlwind ever  she landed in the courtyard  right outside her tower 
aila  coming outside carrying a basket of laundry  shook her head   making a spectacle like always  i see  
 the people love it   said sayen as the whirlwind dissipated behind her   they know how strong i am  and once i m an immortal  i can perform miracles for them   she looked at the carefully polished dagger in her hand and smiled   i ll lead the senghan empire to greatness  
 it s already great enough if you ask me   maya appeared behind aila  hauling a second basket   isn t it the ruling empire of the four great empires  the leader of the new world  defeater of the wicked  barbaric empires 
sayen looked cautiously at maya   i know its problems  i know of the rebel factions growing in the south  i know the rest of the world hates us   sayen took a deep breath   i can fix all that  the immortal will unite all the empires and destroy all evil  just like the legends say  once i m strong enough  senghan will be the true and righteous leader of the world  
maya scowled and opened her mouth  aila bumped shoulders with her   okay  okay  enough  why don t we  
 
page  6 a low booming horn rang out from the watchtower on the opposite side of the palace at its
gates in three short blasts  everyone froze 
 a warning   sayen frowned   but those are only used for  
 the andhinese   said maya  her eyes wide   they re in trouble  
sayen looked at her   let s go to the throne room  
maya flung away the laundry baskets on a small current of wind and the three of them raced inside towards the depths of the palace 
the throne room was packed  despite the early hours of the day  all the nobles were gathered around the hall  the servants behind them and in the doorways craning their necks to see  sayen managed to stand beside the dais on which the throne stood  the empress resided in it with all her usual grace and boredom  her elbow resting on the side and her hand curled under her chin  her jeweled headpiece was delicately arranged on her hair  which was draped carefully around her  her long flowing dress could barely be seen under the ropes of gold necklaces  her eyes  heavily outlined with kohl  were trained on the thin  raggedly dressed and trembling woman standing and bowing below her on the floor  the woman wore a shawl wrapped around her head in an attempt to cover her lack of hair 
 please  your highness   said the woman   we are starving  our children are dying  there is no rain  our crops are gone  we need help  
the empress sighed  then said   i have already sent caravans of food south  
the woman shook her head   it s not enough  they aren t properly guarded  half of them are robbed on the way  and it won t last us for long  you need to    
 so now you re telling me how to rule   the empress raised her eyebrows  sayen gaped at her mother 
the woman was shaking   no  your highness  your grace  no  we just   we have no rain  no water  if you could   if only you could let us in    
the empress waved her hand in dismissal   guards  send in the next one  
 no   sayen raced to the front  standing in front of the woman and glaring up at her mother   what are you doing  these are our people and they need our help  why aren t we letting them into the cities  
 sayen   her mother hissed  straightening up   don t speak of things you don t understand  the cities are at full capacity  
 i do understand   sayen looked her mother straight in the eyes   if you won t let them in  then let me go to them   she curled her fist around her dagger   i ll help them  
 fine  one day  then you will come right back at once  
sayen smiled 
she rode out the very next day alone in a carriage with the woman  waving away aila s protests and maya s silent frowns  they didn t know she could do this  they didn t know of the
 
page  7 nights she spent training on mountaintops far away from the towns and cities  alone with the
heavens  no one knew 
people gathered around the carriage when they arrived  their eyes big in their hollowed faces  clutching at crying children  sayen stood in front of them   don t worry anymore  i have the strongest spirit core in all the empires  i master all the elements  i will save you  i promise  
she raised her dagger to the sky  feeling her core rumble within her  an answering boom thundered from the sky  the heavens were listening 
take my water  she gripped her dagger  feeling the energy flow out from her core  take it all  and rain it upon these villages 
the heavens thundered in anger  sayen clasped her dagger with both hands  i m the chosen immortal  i already know  you will listen to me 
there was a sharp pull in her chest and sayen gasped  her eyes watering at the stinging pain  a hollow feeling rang out inside her  making her stomach turn  the heavens gave one last thunder before dark grey clouds gathered in the sky  letting down their first smattering of rain  the people gasped and cried and bowed at sayen 
the woman beside her was clutching her tunic and sobbing   thank you  princess  thank you  i m sorry  i m so sorry  thank you  i m    
sayen took her hands in confusion   why are you apologizing   surely the woman didn t know what sayen had done  what she d given up   the empire wronged you  i m only making it right  
 princess   sayen turned around at one of the guards who had ridden with her  a messenger eagle on his arm   there s been an attack on the palace  we must hurry back  
sayen s mouth dropped open and she turned towards the woman  her bowed  quivering figure  then she shook her head and raced towards the carriage   let s go  
the city was in chaos  soldiers marched through the streets as citizens scrambled to get whatever food they could grab and hide inside their homes 
it was one of the southern rebel factions that had attacked the palace  killed the guards  nobles and servants in the outer courtyards and raced away in a tornado  just as they had come in  they had left a bloodied note pinned to the chest of the head guard  it was a declaration of war 
 why   sayen whispered as she huddled with maya on the side  aila was with her mother who had escaped by doing her work in a small laundry room away on the other side of the palace  the palace rang with sobs and heartbreak as people scrambled to bury their loved ones and soldiers suited up for battle   the war was so long ago  and these andhinese belong here  
maya shook her head   come on  sayen  you saw the villages  you heard the empress  nobody here cares about them  this was only a matter of time  
sayen swallowed  the villagers had tricked her  but they hadn t made her give up her water powers  that had been her choice  because she d wanted to help  to be a savior  and she was so sure  so sure she was strong enough even without it 
 
page  8  anyway   maya continued   those andhinese weren t from the villages  their clothes were
different and they carried andhin styled curved blades  
sayen turned to her   then they re from   from andhin itself  but they would ve had to cross the ocean  and their ships aren t big enough to carry an entire army  
maya sighed   you people have outdated information  they ve been getting resources from the other empires  the water folk lent them their ships  the ocean is nothing to them now  
sayen stared at her   and you didn t say anything   maya shrugged   would the empress have believed me   sayen was silent 
   
the army would be here within a day 
the palace was stocked up  their warriors as ready as they could be  the nobles and servants huddled in the old hideout caves dug beneath the palace  sayen could see aila helping her anxious mother settle inside  maya with them  then she watched the empress and her siblings go down into the caves without a backwards glance at her and turned away  grabbing a thick padded tunic and armor from the weapons room  she had only two of her elementals but she was still the strongest  all the meditations and trainings  shaping both her body and spirit  it was all for this  she would fight for her people  she would make this right 
she d barely made it out the palace courtyard gates when a slim brown hand grabbed her  sayen spun round and looked up at aila  her long hair piled up for the first time behind her head  her face grey but mouth firm and determined  sayen gaped at aila s padded tunic  coat of mail  slim trousers and the sharp curved knife clutched in her hand  one of maya s   you don t even know how to use that  
aila scoffed   i didn t have your fancy teachers and lessons but i learned well enough on my own   she swung her knife in a downwards arc and the ground beneath them cracked   and i never really cared about all that talk of weapons being impure and shameful  maya s always used them   she glanced at sayen   you heard that old woman  we all have the same ancestors  
sayen looked away from aila s sharp eyes   you could still get hurt  
aila s grim face broke into her familiar smile   so could you  and this is my home too  
   
the senghan army gathered outside the city  its gates firmly shut  the warriors with the strongest earth powers near the front  the younger soldiers up in the town s watchtowers  aila was positioned towards the back near the city s entrance  sayen stood firmly in the front  looking out into the empty desert landscape  there were no towns or villages nearby  this would end safely here 
it happened in the blink of an eye  strong gusts of wind ruffled the army  making everyone s eyes water  then an enormous hurricane whipped up towards them out of nowhere  throwing apart the senghan army  blowing away the soldiers all the way till the town gates  yells and screams rang out into the air  sayen gasped from where she had been thrown against the wall that barred away the
 
page  9 town  there was no time  the andhinese had ridden on the hurricane s wild currents  they were
upon them 
sayen fought with all she had  she grabbed the sharp  ice edged wind currents thrown her way with her bare hands and flung them back with twice the strength  she helped the soldiers make the earth tremble and crack and open up beneath the andhinese  but they simply caught the wind and rode their way out 
she could see aila among the flurry of soldiers  her knife swinging in practiced strikes  tearing up the ground beneath the andhinese  using the rubble to rain a flurry of rocks over the enemy  but they shattered the falling rocks with their long swords 
then a flurry of needlelike glacial winds blasted in sayen s direction and she quickly threw up a rock barrier in front of herself with a thrust of her dagger  to her horror  the rock started crumbling beneath the relentless wind blasts  small razor sharp winds escaping through and tearing at her  scraping bloody welts down her arms and face  how  how could they be stronger than her 
she clutched her dagger and begged the heavens to let her use every ounce of wind within her until there was none left  she fought until her vision clouded and her lungs were seizing  and then her wind powers vanished  but she couldn t stop  the andhinese kept on coming and coming  she wouldn t stop  the heavens were with her  they d listened to her  she was their chosen one  she had to be 
she tore and cracked and smashed through anyone who came at her  and soon  no one did 
the once empty desert was littered with bodies and flooded in a red that looked like a glistening black in the moonlight  she was standing alone in the middle  gasping  crying  had she won  had they won  why was everyone dead  where were the andhinese soldiers  did she get them all 
she stumbled away towards the town  tripping over the bodies  head spinning  she stopped to throw up then continued on  the gates were broken  dead soldiers lined the entrance  why  why 
she walked on  her shoes torn up  her feet sore and bleeding  she walked on  through the quiet darkened streets  the silver moon lighting up the broken rubbles of homes  the dead bodies  no  no  the hurricane  those soldiers  had they been yet another distraction 
the palace was destroyed  walls crumbled into piles of stones  the servants and nobles had been pulled up from the caves and lay scattered around the courtyard  she wouldn t look at them  wouldn t look for familiar faces  she wouldn t 
then she heard the sounds of celebration coming from deeper in the palace  the throne room  or what was left of it  the throne and altar smashed into pieces and the andhinese flag hoisted on top of the ruins with its bow and dagger insignia  the crowd of soldiers in the room cheered as bodies lay lined up in the front  sayen  hidden behind a still standing part of the wrecked walls  spotted the embroidered trails of a familiar garment on one  the empress s favorite dress   she stumbled away and ran outside  dizzy and trembling  vision blurred  a strange roaring sound in her ears 
   
 
page  10
 she managed to make her way to the palace gates before collapsing to her knees  hands digging into the earth  useless  useless hands that didn t have the strength they should  that were still clutching the dagger in a blood slicked fist  knuckles white 
noises slowly filtered into her ears  footsteps  clamoring  yelling   but she didn t look up  not even when a voice finally rang out   the youngest princess  she s still alive  
 isn t she the heavens  chosen one  
 does it matter now  look at her  groveling at our feet like she should    tear out her magic  
 chop off her hands  
 we ll have her head on a spike  
 wait  
sayen jolted and lifted her head  eyes wide and stark in her ashy brown face streaked with blood and filth and tears  she knew that voice  a soldier broke off from the horde surrounding her and walked up to her  sayen blinked away the blurriness until the hazy figure took shape  wearing not a soldier s uniform but servant s clothes 
ice shot through her veins  locking her limbs  freezing her  her breaths were shallow  heaving  chest aching  then maya spoke   she s halfway dead  i can barely sense her powers anymore  and     maya bent down  plucked the dagger out of sayen s slack grip and straightened  raising it over her head   this dagger enhanced her powers  i taught her to use it myself  made her the best she could be  without the dagger  she s nothing  
excited murmurs broke out among the crowd  but sayen only had eyes for the girl in front of her 
maya went on   we ll let her go  show the world what we do to those who wrong us  and all the empires will join forces with us at last  
the soldiers hollered and cheered  stomping their feet and raising their swords  maya looked down at her  face blank and eyes distant   you d best leave quick now  
who was she  had she planned this from the start  when they found her as a half starved  quivering  whip of a girl outside the palace gates all those years ago  when the three of them would sit huddled in sayen s room  talking all night  when maya impatiently taught sayen how to grip her dagger  sayen groaning dramatically  aila laughing at them  when had she betrayed her  when  her brain stumbled over the past few days  all the choices she d made  sayen opened her mouth   wh  where s aila  
a strange look flitted over maya s face before it smoothed out  becoming blank again   she s alive and she s with me  i ll keep her safe   sayen heard the unsaid words  she chose me 
   
the palace gates grinded shut behind her and sayen gazed out at her devastated city  then she started walking 

page  11 she had lost  she had failed  and still she went on walking through the city  the skies
rumbled above her  then the heavens whispered 
you only have one more left  one more  give it to us and you will be hollow  give up your earth and you will be immortal 
sayen looked up at the sky  the wind was howling around her  drying the tear tracks on her face  she opened her cracked lips  she couldn t speak  immortal  the chosen one  is that what it was  a hysterical laugh bubbled up her throat 
the immortal who would help destroy the evil and unite the rest of the empires  she clamped her lips down on another laugh 
 okay   she whispered  the skies thundered  the ground cracked and broke apart beneath her feet and a piercing pain shot through her  like a thousand knives stabbing her insides  as if her very soul was carved out of her 
sayen let out a great shuddering gasp when it finally ended  she found the empty scabbard still strapped to her waist and moved to throw it away  then stopped 
she was an immortal  and her people were dead  betrayed  her empire finished  so what now  what now 
a long ago unwanted whisper of the past echoed in her head  you just got to go on 
very well  she picked her way through the bodies  the scattered carts and food  the dead animals  the rubble  very well  she would go on
