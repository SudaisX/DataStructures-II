the story seller
qisa tajir sold stories for a living  a standard story with a mediocre happy ending was worth 2000 rupees  a story with an exceptional happy ending would usually cost 5000 rupees but the right buyer  a desperate one  would give as much as 1 lakh for such a story  these stories were not normal  they weren t meant to be read  the stories qisa sold changed lives  cured diseases  lifted curses  united lovers  a man wanting to get rid of his debt would come to qisa looking for a story which would serve his purposes  qisa would look in his library  find the perfect tale and give it to the man  the next day the man s debt would no longer exist and qisa s credibility would remain unquestionable 
his shop was located in a little village in the zhob district of balochistan  the village  resting comfortably in the rocky crevices of two mountains  had a small population but several problems  qisa knew that his ability to bestow favourable  fairytale esque endings to anyone he pleased would bring him great profit in a village where almost everyone was trying to either fix something or get rid of someone 
the day qisa arrived in the village he promised he would stay for a short while  but now it had been 10 years since the false promise and qisa was sitting behind a dusty desk in his shop  it was one of those cold winter days when the moon rested behind dark clouds  snow slowly fell on the ground as the bitter wind ran through the empty streets  qisa knew no one would visit his shop today  the fire in his hearth caste gloomy shadows on his bookshelf which lined the wall behind him 
winters were always bad for his business  the days ended abruptly  by late afternoon the sky would turn an eerie shade of blue  people seldom left the warmth of their houses unless absolutely necessary 
qisa stared at the clock on his wall  another hour and he would close up  he looked at the piece of parchment on his desk  it was a list of stories he wanted to forge  some endings which may come in handy for future clients  qisa was contemplating his list when he heard the creak of his wooden door  mistaking the sound for the howling wind  he went back to his list when he felt a presence in front of him 
it was a boy  pale and cold  he was tall but not taller than qisa  his black  smooth hair was ruffled  an old worn out shawl covered his black shalwar kameez which qisa noticed was speckled with mud and snow  the first thing that struck qisa was how beautiful the boy was but there was something uneasy about his silent presence in his shop  and the other thing he noticed was that the boy s right eye was covered with a makeshift patch  an injury perhaps  qisa was intrigued  he looked at the boy who in turn stared at him with sadness but defiance  qisa looked at the clock  30 more minutes and he could close up  maybe the boy was lost  it didn t look like he had any money anyways 
 uh    how can i help you   qisa said to the boy  his voice faltering  the boy looked around the shop and settled his gaze on the books behind qisa

 surprise laced qisa s voice   you want a story  is something troubling you  hahaha  what could possibly trouble a child  
the boy was not amused   what do  you  understand about trouble  a wizard who can simply wish his problems away   qisa felt the flame in the hearth waver as the boy spoke 
 i am here because unlike you  i had to live with my  troubles  for a very long time  i am here because god created a monster and then allowed it to walk his sacred land  
qisa felt his blood run cold  the words spoken by the boy pierced his heart and settled there like an unwelcome guest  the wind continued howling as a storm raged outside  the banging of a distant  rogue window could be heard  for some reason qisa became aware of the looming mountains surrounding the village  how his scream would not even echo but forever be lost to the endless unknown 
 i see you are a serious buyer  tell me  what story do you want  what problems do you face  are you looking for something specific   qisa got up from his chair and started rummaging through his messy shelves  he picked out several books and placed them in front of the boy 
 well  what will it be  you are a buyer  right  i will close my shop in another 10 minutes so better hurry up   qisa tried to sound cheerful but he could not ignore the fear in his heart 
the boy gave a quick glance towards the books and looked at qisa again   i am afraid your usual tales will not work for me  i need to get rid of a curse  a dark one  one which my mother passed on to me  
the boy touched the patch covering his right eye  qisa noticed and said   well if it s an injury then no problem  i can give you a tale which will make you good as new by dawn  if you would only  
 no   said the boy  his calm demeanor unsettled qisa   it is not an injury  i will need something powerful  something that can     the boy wanted to say something  but deliberately stopped his words   i need the most powerful tale you have  one which could change destiny  erase the past  
qisa noticed the look on the boy s face  no matter where he went or who he dealt with  the desperation always gave a customer away  but the boy not only looked desperate but greedy  there was a thirst in him for the unattainable  the sort of person who would accept death if it meant getting what he wants 
 the strongest tale i know will give you everything and more  it will give you power and make you rich  it will make destiny bow at your feet  you will be able to create a new past  destroy futures  the world will be in your grip  but it is costly and i am afraid you won t be able to pay for it  
 and what is the cost   asked the boy

 qisa gave the boy a stern look   your soul  and even then there is no guarantee that death won t take you before you can even touch the pages of this story   the storm continued to rage outside  the silence in the shop amplified the agonizing song of the wind 
for a moment no one stirred and then the boy said   how do i get this story  do i give you my soul  
the innocence of the question amused qisa  this is one strange boy  he thought   i don t exactly have the story with me  but i can tell you where to find it  a divine deity lives on top of takht e sulaiman  the highest point of the mountain range found in the sherani district  this deity is said to be the source of all magic in this land  including my powers  it can forge this story for you  
 yes  i have heard of the legendary mountain before  but how do i get there  
 the district lies north of this village  that land is mostly rural  gone to waste and i do not know what sort of difficulties you may face on your journey  but i do know that at the base of the mountain is a forest made out of mirrors and those who have tried to reach the deity have suffered greatly in that forest   caution laced qisa s words as he spoke to the boy 
 how much do i owe you for this information  
 i will charge nothing  i only ask that if you are successful  you come meet me and tell me about your journey and the reason behind it  but you can t leave right now  there is a storm outside  it is dark  you will get lost  you will die before you get anywhere near sherani  why don t you stay here for the night  wait for the weather to get better  i can give you shelter and   
the boy raised his hand to silence qisa   i think you have given me everything i need  i thank you and i will keep my promise  if i am successful i will tell you about my journey and why i had to do this   before qisa could say anything else  the boy gave a sharp nod and turned towards the door 
qisa heard the creak of the door once more but this time he was left alone  the wind banged against his shop pleading to be let in  qisa felt strange  as if he had set something in motion  something strange and terrible

the boy with nightmares in his eye
he felt like he had been travelling for months but it had only been 2 days since he saw the story seller and set out on his journey towards takht e sulaiman  the snow had stopped falling but the road remained uneven and slippery  he spent the days making slow progress towards the mountain  the nights he spent shivering underneath trees  body stiff and aching  he ate whatever berries or leaves he could find  he was used to eating leaves  his mother would often boil them and they would eat them on cold nights when food was scarce 
for the most part his journey was easy  mountains overshadowed his path like protective guardians  he didn t meet anyone else on the road except for the occasional goat herder  he thought about takht e sulaiman  the treacherous mountain he would soon have to climb  the legend around it was popular  solomon stood atop the mountain peak and looked to the east  only to see utter darkness enveloping the land  there w  as  a darkness present here  a transparent shadow which pressed against his mind  made his hidden eye ache  the nightmarish visions which invaded his reality  the horrible dreams gliding across his mind as he tried to sleep  were signs of that terrible darkness making its presence known to him  soloman abandoned this land when he saw the darkness  but he was walking straight into its jaws 
he also thought about his mother  although these reminders were not welcomed  he often had nightmares about her  these hellscapes always included his mother and always ended the same way  he would remember desperate pleas and bloody hands  a chilling scream coursing through his memories  everytime he would have these nightmares  his right eye would hurt  it felt like some unimaginable horror was trying to escape  his head erupting with pressure  his right eye felt hollow and cramped at the same time  as if it was a vast expanse but one that was filled with tiny  scurrying insects  he would do his best to manage these aches  remembering what happened the last time he couldn t control himself 
he kept on moving  only stopping for sleep  on the third day he had an unexpected visitor  he was walking along the path  pulling his shawl closer to his body when  out of the corner of his eye  he thought he saw his mother  he glanced at the trees  perfectly quiet and still and turned around only to find his mother standing before him  she looked weak and old  her dupatta was speckled with blood  her edges were blurred and in her chest was a large gaping hole  he knew she wasn t actually there but fear and panic gripped him 
he remembered the horrid things that his mother had done to him  the attempts she had made to end his life but for some reason he also felt the need to apologize  tears building up in his visible eye  he was about to say something but his mother gave him a strange  monstrous smile and forcefully pulled her heart out of the gaping  bloody hole in her chest  she looked at the heart and then offered it to him  he closed his eye  waiting for the horrible phantom to do something but there was nothing  only the bitter wind

 he kept seeing her throughout his journey  behind trees  standing at the end of a dark path  her hallucinatory presence unsettled him but he knew that once he had the story this would all end 
on the fourth day he could see the peak of takht e sulaiman towering in the distance and after walking for a few hours he found himself on the edge of the forest the story seller spoke about  from the edge  the forest stretched like an empty void  he could only make out the faded shapes of trees and a dark path leading into the unknown  cautiously he entered the forest  remembering the story seller s words 
underneath his worn out rubber slippers he could feel frost  it was too dark for him to see  but slowly his eyes adjusted and he saw in front of him a face  his own  staring back  the forest was strange  just as the story seller had said  it was made out of mirrors  everywhere he turned he could see his haggard reflection staring back  emerging from the frost covered forest floor were several massive trees  their trunks were made out of jagged mirrors  uneven and blurred by the frost  their branches stalked out of the trunk like thin  pale hands  they were adorned with hundreds of tiny leaf shaped mirrors  they sparkled like stars caught in the branches  a canopy of these branches formed strange glowing shadows on the forest floor 
there were blurry mirrors and shattered mirrors  mirrors in pristine conditions and ones which decay had overtaken years ago  some were clustered together to form odd shaped bushes  others were scattered around  where the frost had cracked some of the trees  sharp mirrors protruded at irregular angles waiting to pierce skin 
the forest was serene  an ominous silence had settled on the mirror trees  it was cold and fog slowly moved through the forest with a life of its own  there was no sign of the sun  however  the boy noticed a phantom glow illuminating the narrow path he had to walk on 
he started walking and soon realised why the story seller had warned him  he saw himself distorted  fragmented into tiny pieces  the forest made him dizzy  occasionally he would mistake his own reflection for someone else  the boy was scared  it would be tricky to find his way out of the forest  he tried walking in a straight path but the sudden appearance of a tree and his tired reflection would cause him to stray away  he spent an hour trying to traverse the impossible forest and after avoiding the sharp touch of rouge mirror branches  thin and cold as icicles  he stumbled upon a small clearing 
unlike the rest of the forest the clearing was brighter  the frost here was thin and the air crisp  surrounded by the mirror trees on all sides  it felt like a tiny reprieve from the maddening chaos of the rest of the forest  he entered the clearing carefully and stood in the middle inspecting the sky above  the first time he had seen the grey sky since he set foot in the forest  he looked around again and realised that from where he stood his reflection was perfectly mirrored on all sides  he felt trapped  like a piece of meat ready to be devoured by circling vultures

 he was about to exit the clearing when he noticed something  the mirror right in front of him was not a reflection of the tired boy  instead he saw an old man  his father  he looked at the odd reflection  he remembered his father as a vibrant  joyous man before tragedy took him away  however  the reflection was aged and weak  time had settled on his skin and in his bones  raising a shaky  withered hand  his father pointed towards him and then moved his hand towards his own chest 
the boy saw as the old man forced his hand inside his chest  blood spreading on his brown kameez  he forced his hand deeper  his nails digging at skin  trying to tear out flesh  the reflection started gasping for air and after extreme struggle and discomfort  he pulled out his heart  the boy  sickened by the grim reflection  watched in terror as his father offered the bloody heart to the boy  his face contorted into a plea as if he was desperate to give it to him  the boy took a step back and turned the way he came  wanting to leave the clearing immediately  but standing before him was another reflection 
this time he saw a young man  he had broad shoulders and a strong jaw  his hair was black and ruffled  he stared at him with a dark intensity  he was beautiful but there was something wrong with him  there was a patch on his right eye and in his right hand he held a blackened  charred heart  the boy was frightened  he did not understand these reflections  he wanted to run away  wanted to be far away from this place  the shadows in the clearing shifted and he noticed his mother with a heart in her hand  he saw his father again  all of these grim visions advancing towards him through the mirror trees 
he ran  he didn t know where he was going  he blindly ran away from those horrid reflections  he kept on running until he collided with a tree and saw  to his surprise  that it was a normal one  he brushed the dirt from his clothes and looked around  the forest was nowhere to be seen  he didn t know where he was or what direction he had come from  he was standing at the bottom of a rocky mountain and when he looked up he realised he was at the base of takht e sulaiman 
he could see the great peak covered in snow  it looked formidable  a towering giant keeping watch over the land  it would be impossible to climb this mountain  he thought  he looked around for a path  tried to find a secret passage but to no avail  he then found some sharp rocks and decided to use them to slowly make the climb  he ripped out two thin pieces of fabric from his shawl and tied them around his rubber slippers so that they won t fall off  with his makeshift tools and a prayer on his tongue  he started to make the climb 
it was an extremely difficult task  it was difficult to find stable footing in the loose rock  the sharp rocks he was using to move himself upward were blunt  it was difficult to dig them into the rocky mountain  his knees scraped across the rough terrain  flesh tearing away with every movement  his hands ached  a new cut appearing every time he dragged his body against the steep mountain side  he went on like this for several hours  sweat matted his hair  his entire body ached and shivered 
there were moments when he felt like giving up  his muscles losing their grip around the rocks but each time he would remind himself of the story and the terrible past he had to endure and those grim reflections  he wanted all of it to end  these thoughts remained with him as he made the

 excruciating climb  after what felt like hours  he could feel gentle snow falling  he was near the top  he continued for another hour and found himself on the edge of a large landing  he made the final effort of pushing himself up and fell on the solid  snow covered ground  he didn t move for a long time  he remained still as the pain in his limbs flared up  his right eye started hurting again 
he found the strength to get up and noticed the opening of a cave  this is where the deity must live  he thought  he slowly moved towards the cave  regretting his decision to leave behind his shawl as the mountain cold raged around him 
the entrance led to a large  hollow chamber  a single  circular hole in the ceiling allowed a broad strip of light into the cave  illuminating a strange pool of black water in the middle of the cave s floor  engraved around the pool were the words 
د یو څاڅکي وینې قرباني کړئ او هغه څه ومومئ چې تاسو یې غواړئ
the boy bit into his finger to draw blood and then let the blood fall into the black pool  for a moment nothing happened  and then the cave rumbled with a terrifying ferocity  loose rocks fell around him as the boy tried to find cover  the black water in the pool parted and moved towards the ceiling  it s shifting  morphing form writhed and thrashed around in the air  he noticed the water give way to two black limbs  a pair of red eyes and flowing dark hair  the deity was shrouded in liquid darkness  besides its clawed hands  grey face and red eyes  the rest of its body faded into the shadows of the cave  as if they were one and the same  the boy looked on in wonder as the deity turned its gaze towards him 
in a feeble voice he finally spoke   the story seller guided me towards you  he told me you could forge a story for me  the most powerful one  
the deity stared at him with curiosity  it spoke  but the voice had no source  it echoed through the cavernous chamber  drifting into his ear   you have come for the kalmat sayah  i told that old fool not to disclose my location  tell me  why do you want this story  
 i deserve it   the boy said with a renewed sense of determination 
the deity gave a condescending laugh   you think you deserve it  what about the ones who came before you  who also thought they deserved it  but only perished   the deity moved closer to him  its body slithering in the dark 
 i am not concerned with anyone else  i deserve it because i was wronged  my mother treated me like dirt  i was cursed with this eye because my mother      his voice started breaking  he didn t want to continue  he felt ashamed that he had to justify his deservance  why must he explain everything he did  what could be more humiliating than to explain your worth when everyone else is blind to it  especially when it was his right  his reward for this cursed life 
 because your mother did what  you have to tell me  otherwise i cannot help you   said the deity with a firmness which chilled his bones

 the boy looked at the shadows on the cave walls  they were moving in unnatural motions  the sight unsettled him  he considered what the deity said  his right eye flared up with pain  every time he thought of his past his right eye would hurt  he would remember certain things  certain words exchanged in the dark  certain actions which forever set in motion the corruption of his memories  the deity gave him a grim stare 
 my mother went insane when i was still inside of her  she tried to get rid of me   he didn t want to talk anymore  this was his moment of greatness  instead he felt weak   she murdered my father and ate his heart while i was still inside of her  she hoped that somehow that would kill me but instead her actions cursed me  
raising a hand to stroke the patch covering his right eye he said   i was born with this  a mark of my mother s hatred towards me  when she saw my eye she hated me even more  she called me the devil  but this wasn t my fault  i deserve that story because my own failed me   the boy felt tears in his eye but he wasn t going to cry  not right now  he looked at the deity with defiance   you  need  to give me the kalmat sayah  it is mine  i deserve it 
 do you really   said the deity as it moved closer to the boy   why don t you tell me about your eye  what are you hiding behind the patch  what really happened all those years ago  
no one had seen what was behind the patch except for his mother and she suffered greatly because of it 
 remove the patch boy  i want to know the truth  truth is the only price for the kalmat sayah 
 no  i m never taking this off   his head throbbed with an agonizing pain  he took a step back  he wanted to leave  the pain in his right eye was insufferable now  something was desperate to burst out of his head and burn everything  the voice of the deity filled his head  demanding him to remove the patch  he needed to leave  he took a step towards the entrance but the deity dashed towards him with a clawed hand outstretched  ready to grab his throat  but instead the claw reached for his right eye and removed the patch 
darkness  absolute darkness filled the cave  it screamed and fought  the darkness clawed at the walls  shook the mountain  nightmarish creatures moved around aggressively  shrieks  demonic laughter  monstrous wails erupted from this bizarre display of horror  the darkness was alive but more than that it was hungry  violent urges fuelling the creatures  and all of this darkness  these nightmares were coming out of the boy s right eye  he tried to cover his eye with his left hand but the creatures ripped it apart  he howled in pain  his body was no longer under his control  he tried his best to drift away but the angry voice of the deity pulled him back to the cave 
 you dare lie to me  boy  i know what you really are  i know what you did  you want the kalmat sayah but it rejects you

 he tried to block his ears but his hands felt heavy  he looked down and realised the deity was using its shadows to hold him down  the nightmares kept unfurling from his eye 
 you have filled your head with lies  you do not remember what happened because you refuse to believe  but i shall remind you  
he tried to break free from the shadows but failed  the nightmares filled his vision and somewhere between the deity s shadows and his own monsters  the darkness that shrouded his memory lifted  he remembered his past as it truly was  not the illusion he fed to himself  he remembered his mother and her kind smile  and warm hugs  he saw his bloody hands  his mother pleading with him  he remembered forcing his mother to eat his father s heart  a heart that he ripped out  so that she would become like him  he remembered the fit of rage in which he unleashed his monsters upon his mother who viciously devoured her within seconds 
years of memories perfectly distorted  purposely changed so that he wouldn t remember  now shattered before him  he looked at the nightmares  the ones that he created  they were a part of him  this was his truth  this ugliness  never the light  never the warmth his mother emanated  this horror was his 
 for your lies i give you a black heart  you will never find happiness  you will never be rid of your monsters  your eye will remain an ugly reminder of your falsehood   with these words she sent a dark shadow towards the boy s chest and he fell on his back with a harsh force  he felt a sharp pain in his chest  a spreading darkness which he could not see  he saw the deity slowly retreat back into the black pool 
 no wait  what about my story  i deserve it  i need it  please  it can change me  i can do good  
but the deity showed him no mercy  enraged by the deity s indifference he focused his nightmares on it s receding form  the creatures moved towards the deity but a blanket of shadows stopped their vicious attack 
furious by the assault  the deity brought its own shadows around the boy  its red glare burned through his remaining eye as it roared with fury 
 i will destroy you where you stand  boy  do not challenge me  leave  while i still allow mercy  
 then please kill me  i don t want to live like this   the boy fell on his knees  desperation lacing his voice 
 killing is a kindness you don t deserve  you will live with your hatred and pain  your curse will be a burden on your soul

 the boy did not move  he sat there thinking about his memories and the monsters that now circled the enraged form of the deity  he remembered the mirror forest and the reflections  he looked at his right hand and without thinking  forced it through his chest  at first he felt nothing  and then he looked down to see darkness unfold from his hand  he clawed deeper and felt the warm rush of blood on his hands  he was not going to be cursed  not again  he clawed deeper as he thought about his mother  her memory drowning out the pain as he tried to claw out his heart  he kept forcing his way through flesh and bone  blood drenched his clothes 
the darkness in his hand made it easier and after a while he was holding a black heart  the deity looked stunned as the boy examined the cursed  black  dripping heart in his hands 
for a moment nothing stirred  an unnatural silence invaded the cave and then the boy directed all of his powers towards the heart and crushed it in his hand  a brilliant black light escaped the crushed heart and expelled itself with extreme force  it shot upwards and collided with the moon  which was perfectly aligned with the opening in the ceiling  the boy looked up as the moon changed color  from ethereal white to a suffocating black which smothered all light and then back to its luminous glow  the boy did not register what he had just done  he looked at the gaping hole in his chest and wondered why he was still alive 
the deity looked at the moon with wonder and then back at the boy with pure hatred and
said 
 سپوږمۍ به خپل انتقام واخلي 
it went back into the small pool  turning into black liquid as its form diminished 
the nightmares receded back into his eye  perfectly slipping into the void of his empty socket  the patch that he had used to hide his hollow eye was lying near his feet  he didn t try to pick it up  he looked at the moon once more  it felt different  he felt exalted in its light 
moonlight cascaded into the cave  the pale light gave the cave an eerie glow  but there was something wrong with it  he noticed large  shadowy creatures emerging from the shadows casted by the moonlight  they emerged in multitudes  they growled as they moved towards him  he was scared and was about to run when he noticed what they were actually doing  their forms gathered in the darkness as they slowly bowed before him  waiting for his command 
he looked at the monstrous figures prostrating before him and smiled  i have a promise to keep  he thought
