claws and magic
by anushay zehra rashid
i have met many strange people in my life   everyone from the witches of the west  the jadugarniyaan of the east  and my fellows of the night  my travels have included being hosted by the maharanee of the paree highlands and  on the rare  insufferable occasion  the raja of the sea folk  every noble from the underworld and magical realm would revel in my boundless power yet nothing  no encounter  or ancient text could prepare me for this child 
this story is not so much about me as it is about the fates of the peculiar child and her equally peculiar mother  of course  i may detract the story and speak of my own ills but only as much as is necessary  as amusing as they are  they are but blips against the debacle of a life this child could have had 
this child  let us call her arshi  has a heavy name   goddess durga  a heavenly creature  a ray of first sunshine   yet what she does best is to live up to it  it is often that a creature not born into the magical realm will not exhibit their powers until they are of a pubescent age  in truth that would vary by species  however  as not many of non human descent are born in non magical environments  only information regarding magical humans has been recorded  yet arshi  my dear arshi  was only a year old when her abilities became evident  and as any mother would be  hers was confused  excited  and cautious  but she did not abandon her  instead  she found her books upon books  with tales of fairies and goblins  when she heard these  something within the oblivious toddler would alight the magic around her  wisps of light and sparkling colors surrounded her  outside her bedroom window  the fireflies would glow brighter and flicker with joy  and if ever the window were left open  butterflies would flutter in to gaze upon her  this is how i found her as well  i felt her magic calling me and after traversing across numerous mountains and plains  into the valley of kalash  i finally found her 
she was four years old when i spotted her playing with a paree in her field  a smell of blooming flowers surrounding her  sharp and sweet  the paree would go in and out of flowers as arshi chased her around in the field  one moment she was running and the next she was on the ground  upon realizing she had fallen  her eyes clouded over as darkness gathered around the village  as her tears fell  ominous masses of rain drew into the valley and over the surrounding mountains  an electric breeze ran through the field  and i felt an alarming stillness in the air   the smell of flowers disappeared and turned into the stench of decay  bitter and burning  as the clouds cackled and laughed  i pounced at arshi  heaving her a mere six feet from the location she was  where the ground was now charred and sizzling with static  the remains of the paree  blackened and disparate  laid there convulsing with remnants of the lightning that had descended upon her 
hearing light laughter behind me  i turned to see arshi  lying on the ground  smiling up at me  the smell of sweetness returning as the clouds receded and a ray of sunlight landed on her 
   

arshi s mother  mitra  was a descendant of the parees of the highlands but her bloodline had diluted itself to an extent where one would not expect another magical creature to be born of it  alas  such is destiny  no amount of mortal intervention would change it  as i followed arshi home  i felt the familiarity of her mother s blood  from a fateful meeting many years ago 
as a child  mitra would often find herself in the confines of her room  buried under piles of books  growing up listening to and reading stories of her great ancestors and the histories of the parees mitra acquainted herself enough to be at ease with her magical child  in the winter of her eleventh year  i visited her ancestors as they perched themselves on the trees overlooking her home  the visit was not an ordinary one  it was to witness mitra  with a dear amount of hope in their hearts  perform any semblance of magic 
that night as i stalked some pesky prey  i came across mitra standing next to a bush of rose buds  spotting me she called me over and began explaining the thought process of her simpleton self 
 flower parees can make flowers bloom faster  you know  if i can make these buds bloom  then that would mean i could meet more parees  i would be a paree   the thought alone made her ecstatic 
pretending i did not understand her language  i stood there and watched as she proceeded to direct immense concentration on to the hapless bush to no avail  taking pity on the child  i deduced that i could grace her with one last test  a fairly simple one  talking to her  magic is a peculiar thing  it enables a magical creature to communicate with another even if they do not comprehend the language  even if we are from different species  therefore  if she were magical  she would be able to hear me 
 mitra  my dear  look here   raising my eyes to her   magic flows through your blood as it has flowed through the veins of the many generations before you  it is limitless yet constrained  powerful yet useless without   i stopped as her hand came down on my head patting it  sighing  i resigned myself to the gawking child  she did not contain the magic she had so desired 
rejoining her ancestors i informed them of the confirmation gained  her lack of magic disappointed them but as she crossed their path  terror took over  you see  this paree lineage had acquired a peculiar power  one that enabled them to foresee plausible futures of those a part of their lineage  witnessing mitra s future and the choices she would have to make  her ancestors resolved to escape  crossing to the upperlands  far from calamity that could strike 
forsaking the revelations  they did not reveal to me what they saw  yet  now  with both arshi and mitra standing before me  there was no doubt that a catastrophic future was to come and a foolish destiny to be encountered  forcing a mother to choose between her child and the world  what a fate indeed 
   
why did i stay  you ask  out of curiosity  i suppose  neither arshi nor mitra were dear to me then but they did stir a desire in me  to know where they would lead themselves  that is not to say that arshi and her mother did not make it terribly comfortable for me to stay  putting down a

bowl of food for me every mealtime   dreadfully dry but a kind gesture nonetheless   a pillow for my rest  and all the vermin i could hunt  magical and non magical alike  i was much obliged to stay 
time went by  and while mitra possessed no magical ability  arshi was endowed with a frightening amount that obeyed every whim of the flux of her emotions  i spoke to her about the parees and the jadugarniyaan  of the origins of magic  the sacred waterfall that flowed from everest  and the parees that lived at the bottom of keenjhar lake  her mother would watch as we spoke  not comprehending a word that was exchanged but she could see the light around her daughter and perhaps believed that to be a good sign  this acceptance was  in part  due to her love for the child and to her recognition and love of the magic arshi emitted 
initially  my objective was to teach her empathy for others  empathy is the elementary method to tame the emotions  preventing destruction  unfortunately  the older she grew the more it became apparent this might not be the most suitable path  curiosity often overtook her  the desire to explore the world accompanied her possessive habits and her ignorance to the pain she could cause 
with winter approaching  mitra and arshi ventured into the forest to collect some wild herbs before the frost settled in  curious in nature  arshi wandered and allowed herself to be distracted by the flickers of light that surrounded her   parees of the frost  enticed by the scent of flowers that surrounded her  following her  i assumed she would simply play with them  truly a mistake on my part  reaching her arm out  one fluttered down to perch itself on her finer  a flickering flame emerged from the tips of arshi s hand as the frost paree  body alight  descended to the ground  the smell of scorched flesh filled the air as arshi  eyes glazed over  burned every paree surrounding her  until all that was left was a ring of torched corpses 
it is impossible to say how long she stood there  the stench lingering in the air  in the distance  mitra called out to arshi in an increasingly frantic voice  as her voice grew louder and closer  arshi s consciousness returned  her face lit up as she turned to follow her mother s voice  the smell of flowers returning  walking away from the scene  she spotted me and called me to follow but never looked back at the destruction she left in her wake 
it was in that moment that i began to realize that only something significant would change the fates  teaching empathy may not suffice  she had proven to be apathetic to everyone but her mother  would teaching her to control her powers work  perhaps i should make her hyperaware of them  what about a sacrifice at the hands of her powers  attempting to raise this child was looking to be a ridiculous task  one that was quite amusing to take up 
   
winters came and went  trifling incidents populating the years  while devastating ones were sporadic  some witnessed by her mother  others witnessed by those who could never speak of it again 
in the spring of her twelfth year  arshi became infatuated with small animals   rabbits  squirrels  mongeese  and the occasional bird  following them to their holes and nests  she collected pieces of their homes and lives  taking them back home and sealing them in a box  many times  she had picked acorns  twigs  or leaves  but on occasion  she would retrieve an egg or a rabbit kit from a

newborn litter  sealing everything in a box under her bed  not realizing what that would do to a living being  by the time her mother found them  it would be too late 
repeated exposure to unruly and untamed magic accompanied by nuance or blatant violence had sowed seeds of fear and trauma in mitra causing her to withdraw affection from arshi  this was not blatantly obvious  yet arshi  with all her self awareness   or lack thereof   noticed  they no longer ventured into the forest together for foraging or played together in the fields  an irrevocable distance had been created 
the entire situation had become so terrible that i strolled into mitra s presence one day to find her cowering in a corner of the home  alas  the only comfort i could provide with these old claws was my presence  stroking my head  as she did in her youth  she often spoke about her deceased husband  comparing arshi s sense of adventure and curiosity to his  she often repeated a single line   you know  someday she may not come back from an adventure  just like him   that was the most i knew of him  a truly tragic woman indeed 
   
time and time again  mitra suppressed her true reactions to the oddity that was arshi  she was  after all  her child  while she was well acquainted with the textuality of magic  she had never encountered it before arshi herself but now  her love for magic only devolved into disdain 
i would certainly enlighten her if i could but her limited magical prowess made it inconceivable for us to communicate  in an attempt to ease her mind and inform her of what is to come  i took it upon myself to venture into the upperlands  a place of ferocious  noble parees much different from the common folk of nature that often fell prey to arshi 
strolling through the woods  thirty degrees east from the top of the mountain  i headed towards the gate of the upperlands  to a mortal of no consequence this gate would like an ordinary cave boring into the mountain  however  to those of magic it radiated a glow signifying immense power   unfortunately  still a cave in the mountain  dare i say if i had been tasked with this area  i might have made it more welcoming 
at the end of the cave was the source of the glow  the illuminated palace of the parees  as i entered  lilac skinned beings robed in white silk lined the green carpeted hall and bowed to welcome my presence  while i do believe i am worthy of that respect  it seemed as though they had been expecting me  which made this visit strangely peculiar  no matter how powerful these old crones were  they should not be able to see my future 
 what a pleasant surprise  my friend   croaked a voice from above me  three of arshi s ancestors  who had been blessed enough to find themselves among the ranks of the nobles  descended from the upper levels of the palace  their midnight blue bones shining through their lilac skin  landing a few feet from myself in the great hall 
i began before they could   the child has come of age  and i believe you three owe it to the girl s mother that  
 we owe the girl s mother  

 my dear  we owe her nothing  in fact you owe us  
 your involvement has erased the future we saw  and while you are close to her we cannot see the future you have changed  although  i do not believe it could be any worse than what we have already seen  
 enough   i growled  darkening the glow of the palace and shattering a number of their unseemly crystals  the wind slicing through the bodies of their plebeian servants  manifesting my wrath  i towered over the three fools   you will make yourself known to the mother  and you will ensure that she knows what you saw and what you know  
the fear reflected in their eyes informed me the message was clear  returning to my original size  i cleared my throat and turned to leave   shall we  
   
as we returned to the house  it seemed that it had been a particularly awful night  a circular clearing around the house had been created by the decay of weeds and grasses from what i could only assume was arshi experiencing a nightmare 
as the parees entered  the house was filled with bursts of pink and yellow lights  and the sweet smell of honey  their skin shimmering against the light and white hair trailing behind them  entering the kitchen  their presence had mitra terrified  she almost screamed until she spotted me  walking towards me  she bent down to stroke my head   a source of comfort for her   regaining her composure 
the ancestors introduced themselves  telling her of the future they had foresaw when they had first met her  she had been destined to marry a man who would revitalize the bloodline that flowed within her  the dilution of her bloodline had caused a rip in the continuation of magic  as a consequence of not exhibiting their powers  the magic in the blood had accumulated and become concentrated such that the moment it was exposed to another magical being it exhibited its enormous potential  arshi s father had been part magic  but because he never met his mother he never learned to use it  yet it resided within him  the collision between mitra and the father s bloods resulted in the child that is arshi  with magic oozing from every orifice  however  the immensity of magic came at a price  one that came as a burden on the world  and as mitra s duty to resolve  she could end the chaos before it began or she could let it ensue 
the moment the conversation ended  arshi walked into the room in a daze spotting the group in the middle of the home  she looked between her mother and i and the floating strangers  confusion made its way to her face and she stepped towards mitra  who pulled away from her   an outright rejection  despite the relationship between the two having deteriorated  mitra had never rejected arshi so blatantly  registering this  arshi became inconsolable 
as tears fell from her eyes  the wind began to pick up speed  tearing the windows open  and letting in the rain outside  the smell of death mixed in with the scents of flowers and honey  overpowering it  arshi stumbled backwards and her flames began to surround her  one of the three extended their arm to her in a failing attempt to calm her down  but the flame lunged at them  scorching their lilac flesh to the bone  screeching  they willed themselves away from the havoc 

wielded with no control  the magic attacked with no direction  leaving the powerless mitra with little to no cover to shield herself  i stepped in front of her mother to create a dome that would keep her safe as the remaining ancestors attempted to contain arshi  the wind raged on and the second ancestor was impaled with a shard of ice  mitra screamed  snapping arshi out of her chaos  the fire dissipated as the air began to smell of dew and rain  concerned  arshi attempted to approach her mother but mitra stepped back  holding back tears and her fear  albeit unsuccessfully  the surprise of a second rejection was too much for arshi  and she ran out of the house and away from her mother 
   
i remained by mitra s side for a moment  considering it to be my sacred prerogative to guide her to the fateful moment  i nudged her on  bumping my head against her hand  hoping the human would decide to move before the third ancestor returned  unfortunately  their decision was made before hers  they began to move to pursue arshi  and mitra and i tailed them 
following the evident trails arshi and the paree had left behind  fallen trees and burnt shrubs  we traversed through the forest and up the hill  through this mitra trembled  i imagine she was struggling to make a decision  as we approached the end of the forest and entered a clearing  a dark silhouette formed against the light of the full moon  arshi was standing atop the hill  small and alone  staring into the moon  hundreds of small flames surrounded her  a massacre of floral parees  a bitter smell hanging in the air  behind her  at the foot of the hill stood the ancestor  cautiously making their approach 
raising one arm to the sky  the last ancestor brought down a tirade of lightning to the area  missing arshi by a hair s breadth  reacting to the attack  the wind howled and the rain poured  shards of ice circled the ancestor  an unintelligible skirmish ensued between the two  leaving mitra and i to the side  summoning a dagger  carved from the bones of a paree and cursed by a jadugarni  i placed it before mitra   it would be the means to enact her decision  to save arshi or allow the world to be saved 
picking up the dagger  she looked up at her daughter  in the same moment arshi tumbled to her feet  attempting to escape from the looming threat  she inched backwards until the ancestor towered above her  petrified  arshi looked around wildly for a means to save herself  her storm easing into light rain as the terror in her grew 
beside me  mitra abandoned the dagger and sprinted across the field  throwing herself between arshi and the ancestor  as they brought down a bolt of silver light meant for arshi  struck by the immensity of the deadly magic  mitra s body shuddered and convulsed  an outstretched arm reaching for arshi as she gasped for air 
cradling mitra s body in her arms  arshi s magic raged  the storm that had dissipated returned  ice caged the ancestor as lightning struck them  igniting a fire that began with their robes and encapsulated them  their screams echoing through the night as they burned 
as the screams died and the storm eased  the air carried a murky bittersweet smell  hours went by as arshi held her mother  her mother had proven that she could be loved despite her untamed power that she was worth saving  getting up  she looked towards the moon and the hills

beyond  and began to walk away  after a few steps  she paused  looked down to me   this fool still had not learned my name   i sighed as i heard her say   come on  kitty  
   
that was the story of how i became arshi s familiar and mentor  she is still a fool  her curiosity of life knows no bounds but she no longer harms without reason  perhaps her mother had changed the fate of the world saving it from disaster  perhaps the fate of the ancestors was only the beginning of the destruction to come  but perhaps  just maybe  arshi could mould her own fate now
