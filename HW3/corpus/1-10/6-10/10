june 1962
          

 laila was resting on armaan s chest  her arms were wrapped around his waist and his muscular arms wrapped around hers  they were resting beside a camp fire in a forest with toucans flying over them  fresh breeze was blowing through their hair  the scent of rain and red roses made laila feel like she was in paradise  armaan s light brown eyes twinkled in the sunlight as she looked directly into them  he ran his hands through her hair tucking a strand behind her ear  and said  laila  you re getting late  
 what do you mean   laila smiled  armaan had a habit of cracking silly jokes 
 you re getting late  you imbecile   her mom s angry voice broke through her beautiful dream 
laila jumped up   her eyes half open  her curls tangled into one another  forcing herself up with a jerk gave her a head rush  she sat back down for a moment  once the black dots disappeared from her sight  she looked up towards the clock hanging above her bed  it was 7am  she was late  mrs  chowdry was an unforgiving woman 
 waky waky  laili   laila s stray cat ramu squeaked while crawling on to the bed  his tail fluttering behind him   mommy s mad  you better go  
 i heard you  ramu   laila replied as she ran to the bathroom  she threw on an unironed shalwar kameez and hurried out of the room  all the while having that beautiful dream stuck in her head  oh  how she wished she could go back to sleep and dream a little more  but life always seemed to get in the way 

  you can t afford to lose your job  this family strives on the bread you bring to the table   laila s mother was in the kitchen preparing breakfast for her father 
 and who is to blame for that  amma   laila argued 
 it s too early  please just leave     her mom requested while serving her father with some freshly made tomato omelet and parathas 
laila grabbed some toast and buttered it with a knife as she slid into her sandals 
    and please feed that ugly kaali billi of yours before you leave  he s a pain in the ass   laila s mother ordered 
ramu frowned 
this was a daily routine in laila s house  her father was caught and arrested in a fraud scheme for a housing project three years ago and had been unemployed ever since  her mother was an uneducated woman who made a few bucks every now and then by altering people s clothes  laila was lucky enough to be noticed by mrs  chowdry who gave her work at her local bakery in mirapur  that is when she met armaan for the first time 
          
laila entered the bakery in a rush hoping she would escape mrs  chowdry s eye  the aroma of freshly baked bread swept around the air  laila tied her messy hair

 into a bun on her way to the kitchen  quickly threw on her apron and began preparing the batter for the jalebis 
as she tossed the batter into the frying pan  her mind started to wander  she started thinking about the forest  the red roses  and the beautiful rain  and of course  armaan  no worries of the world  just him and i  deeply in love  she thought  laila s daydreaming was disrupted when she heard mrs  chowdry from the reception 
 that s wonderful  armaan   laila peeked through the kitchen door and saw mrs  chowdry kissing armaan s forehead  she wondered what they were talking about 
armaan began walking towards the kitchen  laila got back to frying jalebis and pretended like she didn t hear anything   hi motu  armaan teased   try to leave some jalebis for the customers as well   laila turned red  she could feel her cheeks becoming warm  butterflies in her stomach  laila felt like a loser unable to control her emotions  surprisingly armaan had never noticed her blush 
 shut up  i have a lot of work to do  stop annoying me   laila said  snatching a warm jalebi from his hand  armaan was wearing a fitted blue t shirt with boot cut jeans  he reminded her of the handsome dilip kumar 
 well  i just came to tell you some good news   but i guess somebody s not interested   armaan said with a smirk on his face   i get it  i ll leave  
 no wait  armaan  what is it   what were you telling mrs  chowdry   laila inquired  curious as ever 
 go ask ammi yourself  i won t tell you now  bye motu   armaan teased 

  armaan     
armaan walked out  only if mrs  chowdri wasn t standing outside like a hawk 
          
 what s wrong  laili   ramu was purring through laila s legs while she washed the dishes  she d been awfully quiet 
 laili  i think i m in love with chinki   ramu declared 
 who s chinki   laila asked totally uninterested in ramu s love life 
 the beautiful white persian next door  she s been giving me hints all day  
 oh  shut up ramu   ramu rolled his eyes and turned his attention back to looking out of the window  he could clearly see chinki munching a bowl of beef biscuits 
laila couldn t stop thinking about what armaan wanted to tell her  what was the good news  did he finally decide to confess  but why would he say that to mrs  chowdry  he is a mama s boy after all   maybe he wanted her blessings first 
it was late  laila had waited hours for armaan to show up at her doorstep to tell her the good news  that he loved her and wanted to marry her   i ve got ammi s

 blessings   now i ve come to ask your parents for your hand in marriage   laila was brought back to reality when ramu jumped in her lap   i m hungry  
that s it  laila thought  this is no way to treat his future wife  she decided to go over to armaan s place and ask him the good news herself 
          
laila covered herself with a large grey shawl and sneaked out of the house  why s he being such a tease  on her way  she started musing about the wonderful times she d spent with armaan in the past three years 
laila remembered the day armaan had taken her for some delicious gol gappas  she had sneaked out of the bakery during her shift and quickly joined armaan outside  who was waiting for her in a tacky multi colored rickshaw which had the actress shabnam s pictures stuck to it all over the back   a rickshaw   laila had asked  confused   where s your car  armaan  
 it s so much fun in a rickshaw   armaan had said  excitedly  laila remembered rolling her eyes getting annoyed  she was used to riding the rickshaw every day  so many casual harassment stories associated with it  but of course a unique experience for a rich kid like armaan 
these memories were etched deeply in her mind  the beach was right next the stall of gol gappas  laila and armaan would sit on the beach side with their plates of

 freshly made meethi puri  they would have a competition of who could finish the plate first  sometimes
armaan would take the meethi puri and feed it to laila with his hands  making her feel like the most special girl in the world 
walks by the beach were normal for laila and armaan  they d spend hours talking about life  food  family  friends  experiences  feelings  thoughts  their future plans  and anything one could possibly think of  laila had thought of confessing her feelings many times but she wished he d do it first  she knew it was only a matter of time 
when armaan left for london for four months for an acting course  laila was upset  and knew she d miss him  but found comfort in the fact that it would be over soon and he d return 
it d been a year to that now  their beach trips had become a rare occasion  and she felt that armaan had become a bit distant  laila managed to brush the thought aside every time but she was starting to get impatient  now that armaan finally had some good news  laila couldn t wait  she walked towards his house as fast as she could  she decided that she d just confess her feelings as soon as she saw him  this way he wouldn t have any choice but to finally confess his feelings too 
it was scary how silent mirapur was at night  the hoot of an owl could be heard from miles away  laila walked as fast as she could  but she couldn t run  she needed to maintain the silence or she d alert the witch  she walked and walked a little faster with each step  armaan s house was located three streets down  at the corner of a park where the creaking of swings and cracking of branches could clearly be heard 

 it was the largest house in mirapur with huge gates protected by guards and guard dogs  she wondered what the best way to enter would be 
laila decided to take the second entrance which led straight to armaan s room through the tree house  armaan had brought her once to show off his new collection of cigars   she d memorized every inch of the house ever since  she climbed the tree house through the wooden stairs which armaan claimed he made himself when he was a child   what a show off  she needed to be careful as the tree house was old and vulnerable to cracks 
the window to armaan s room was right in front of the tree house   a foot away  she d have to jump  wait  why are the lights turned on  stupid guy has work in the morning  someone needs a lecture  he doesn t take care of himself at all  laila thought 
armaan was sitting on the chair next to his study table  focused on typing something on the typewriter  a plate of half eaten food was lying on the right and a half full glass of whiskey on the left  just as laila was about to jump inside she heard a female voice  she saw the door of the bathroom slide open  and a woman  about 5 and half feet tall  walked out with a baby pink towel wrapped around her body  laila felt her heart skip a beat  what s going on here 
the woman walked towards the side of the bed and flipped her hair back and forth  water spattered all over the wooden floor  running her hands through her damp hair  she then walked towards armaan and wrapped her arms around his shoulders 

  what are you working on  sweetheart  it s late  we should go to bed   the woman said 
 i m writing a letter for our relatives abroad  they need to be here for our wedding   armaan answered looking up towards her 
 did you tell laila   the woman asked 
 no  it s fun annoying her   armaan giggled   i ll make sure i tell her in the morning  
 great  i ll come along  can t wait to meet her   the woman said as she slipped into a blue t shirt and black pajamas   i m going to bed  please turn the lights off when you re done  goodnight  jaan  
 goodnight  sweetheart  
laila sat silently crouched in a corner of the tree house  she d stopped blinking  she felt rage building up inside her  who is this woman  where did she come from  how could armaan do this  laila felt like she d been thrown away like trash  her thoughts were starting to consumer her  why  because i m poor  does he not have the balls to stand up to his mother  is he embarrassed  or wait   does this slut have him under some sort of spell   that s it  this has to be it  armaan isn t like this  i know what he feels  i ve seen it in his eyes  oh  how silly i am  doubting armaan s love like that  i ll expose this bitch in no time 
          

 the bakery was super busy that morning  mrs  chowdry was catering a wedding and large batches of gulab jamuns  moti choor ke ladoo  samosas  jalebis  kheer  and mrs  chowdry s special shahi tukre had to be dispatched before noon  laila made sure she reached on time because she knew she d be meeting armaan s fiancé  god knows what kaala jaadu she s done on armaan  laila thought 
she was busy assorting the mithai into boxes   10 gulab jamuns and 10 moti choor ke ladoo in each box  do you understand laila   mrs  chowdri ordered  yes  saasu maa 
laila went to the reception to get more red ribbons when armaan and his fiancé walked in  she was wearing a black kurti with a multi colored patiala shalwar  and a beautiful block printed dupatta  her hair silky straight  her skin glowing in the sunlight coming through the windows  she walked towards laila with armaan  who had a grin on his face   motu  remember i had a surprise for you  
 you never said it was a surprise   laila complained  dreading every bit of the conversation 
 array  same thing   armaan replied in a cheery voice 
 it s not   laila was starting to get more anxious than ever 

  oh ho  laila  stop messing around   armaan said  pulling the woman forward by her arm   meet rukhsaar  my wife  
wife   wife  
laila felt dizzy  nauseous  all she could see were two blobs standing in front of her   armaan  how could you do this to me    laila screamed 
armaan was confused  he noticed that laila was sweating and her eyes were teary and red  he tried to get close to her but laila would keep pushing him away   what s wrong with you  laila  
rukhsaar was just standing there horrified  armaan had told her of his best friend laila  and how she would be delighted to see rukhsaar  looking at laila in such a hysterical state was starting to get her worried 
laila couldn t take the humiliation anymore  everyone in the bakery was staring her  she was embarrassed and felt like a lunatic  mrs  chowdry was outside talking to the delivery men  if she saw laila in this state  she d lose her job  laila ran from behind the reception  pushed armaan to the side  and stumbled her way into the bathroom  the dizziness seemed to have stopped after she threw up  armaan had been banging the door and screaming her name  she didn t want to see him  she needed to see the witch  laila pushed the bathroom window open  pushed herself out  and landed on her knees  she felt something shatter inside her but there wasn t time  she needed to run 
          

 laila ran further and further into the woods  she needed to see the abandoned witch  she knew this  rukhsaar  had armaan under a spell  a spell only the abandoned witch was capable of  my armaan s a victim of black magic  i ve got to save him  she thought  laila ran and ran  not sure where she was headed  she d heard her mother tell her stories of the witch being in hiding for years after she betrayed the fairy godmothers   but soon laila realized she had no destination  she had to find her  she had to save him  she was out of breath  laila started to breathe heavily  her throat longing for just a few drops of water  her vision was clouded  her eyes watery  the next thing laila knew was her head advancing towards a giant rock and everything went blank 
          
laila slowly opened her eyes to see herself lying on a filthy light blue mattress  she saw a glass of water on the floor next to her  a spider web was in the works on all four corners of the room  a rat scurried from one side of the mattress making laila scream and jump up huddling into a corner  she wondered where she was 

 glimpses of her meeting with rukhsaar flashed in front of her eyes  what happened to me  how did i get here  she thought 
the old wooden door of the room slowly creaked open and a woman in a black burkha walked in  only her eyes visible  large and ferocious like a fox  it was pitch dark outside  she was holding a candle lamp in one hand and a brown bag in the other  she looked straight into laila s eyes  laila felt her blood turn cold  her face flushed  she suddenly had the urge to run out of there as fast as she could  but she feared for her life  the witch had kidnapped her 
 how are you feeling  my child  
laila forced words out of her mouth   are you really the abandoned witch  
the woman laughed   nobody s remembered me for days  until you cried for help in desperation  you think i d let this opportunity go to waste  
it really was her  but what opportunity is she talking about 
 um  you know who i am   laila squeaked 
 don t be scared my child  i can help you and you can help me   the witch said with a smirk one her face 
 i don t understand   laila was scared out of her wits  she didn t know what to do   you will  here  have something to eat  
          

 february 2019
 after laila disappeared that day  your dada ji couldn t sleep properly   rukhsaar beghum told neha  her eyes getting teary with every word she spoke   they were very close  when your dada ji met me in london  he couldn t wait for me to meet her  but he had no idea what was going on inside of her  
 why haven t you told anyone the whole story  
 why do you think we rushed our nikkah without anyone knowing   neha could feel her dadi s voice breaking  she sensed embarrassment in her tone   i d gotten pregnant with your father  my mother in law was a wonderful woman  she accepted me with open arms and agreed to arrange our marriage as soon as possible  nobody else knew about my pregnancy  it was to be announced once the rukhsati was done  
    then why did dada ji introduce you to laila as his wife  
 i was against it  i tried to tell him it s better if he calls me his fiancé until the rukhsati  but he convinced me that laila could be trusted  
 does baba know about this  
 of course not  neha  your father grew up in the same neighborhood as everyone else  a neighborhood where carrying a child out of wedlock is unacceptable  i raised

 your father as a single mother  i was more vulnerable  mummy ji and i decided that it was best never to mention it again  
neha understood  she wrapped her arms around her dadi s shoulders and held her close to calm her down 
 what happened after laila disappeared  
          
june  1962
laila realized that she wasn t kidnapped  the witch had an agenda  she wanted something from laila and was willing to give her something unimaginable in return   a portion of her powers  laila s fear started to die down when she was assured by the witch that hurting laila wouldn t be of any use to her 
 how did you know armaan and rukhsaar met in london   laila questioned 
the witch smirked   you underestimate me  child  
laila was enraged  if armaan wasn t under any spell  why was he doing this  laila was starting to develop an intense hatred for everyone in her life  her parents didn t care about her  her father was a fraud  her mother dumped all financial responsibilities on her  she d worked and saved money like a lunatic since she was 19  only to come home to no appreciation at all  she left her studies  she was forced

 to grow up  leave all her dreams  all her goals  confiding in armaan gave her hope  she was beginning to trust again  she finally had someone to rely on  and before she knew it  she was obsessed  meeting him every day  spending time with him  goofing around with him  what was all that if not love  
laila was turning red with anger  how dumb was she to think that poor little armaan had become victim to a spell  he never loved her  all he did was lead her on  all those long walks by the beach  giving her nicknames  confiding in her whenever he needed advice  and occasionally holding her hand too  laila felt used  betrayed  she decided never to let armaan and rukhsaar live happily ever after  she wanted revenge  and she wanted it fast 
 you can really give me magical powers   laila asked  curious 
the witch smiled at laila  she was sitting in front of her  chewing on the bones of a dead rabbit   but i don t understand  what s in it for you   laila questioned 
 my magic isn t strong enough  i was abandoned after i was accused of betraying the fairies  i need an army to get my revenge  i ll have double the powers if you join me  and together we can both get what we want  
 so if i agree i ll be a   witch  
 is that what they re calling me out there   the witch joked 
laila had nothing to lose  nobody cares about her  nobody thinks about her  nobody loves her  and now armaan s one of them  he s going to pay   do what you have to do  

 the witch grinned  within seconds she was swirling her black magic wand in circles  grey smoke started to form and surround laila  she was starting to feel giddy  the smoke started entering her nose  her mouth  her eyes  her ears  and soon her throat started burning up  laila wanted to scream but couldn t  the witch wouldn t stop  laila fell to the ground gasping for breath but the smoke started to pile up  she couldn t see anything  she couldn t feel her arms and legs  the room started to spin  a rare unbearable high pitched sound was blowing in her ears  laila felt like she would lose all her senses  just as laila thought she couldn t take it any longer  the smoke started to die down  the noise started to fade  the room slowly stopped spinning 
as the room became clear  laila noticed that the witch had fainted and fallen to the ground  unable to stand up  laila dragged herself towards her  blood was coming out of her nose  her face had become as white as snow  something s gone terribly wrong  laila was scared  was the witch dead  she shook her with great force  hoping she d wake up  laila was skeptical about whether the witch s little magic trick had worked  clearly it took too much out of her since she d fallen to the ground 
          
the witch wouldn t wake up no matter what laila did  she tried shaking her  spattering water on her face  calling her out  but nothing worked  seemed like years of abandonment weakened her powers  performing the ritual sucked all the life out of

 her making her fall to the ground  dead  her magic really wasn t strong enough  the witch s plan to get revenge on the fairy godmothers had failed 
laila started walking back towards town  her time was wasted  everything the witch promised seemed too good and easy to be true  however  laila didn t understand what was going on inside her  she felt weird  different  every time she thought about armaan and rukhsaar  the rage she felt inside her was ten times greater  she felt a swirl form up inside her stomach which made her throw up  she had to drink water from the grimy bottle she d taken from the witch s room in desperation to regain control of her body  she was sweating excessively  her eyes watering to no end causing laila to constantly rub her eyes and clear her vision  where was all of this uncontrollable rage coming from 
as laila was passing the woods on her way back  she heard a hiss  she looked around her but nothing was there  she continued to walk and there it was again  another hiss  what is that  she froze in one place as the voice started to get louder and clearer  laila turned around  and noticed a large snake with yellow scales speedily advancing towards her  just as it was about to pounce  both of laila s hands were horizontally pushed up in front of her as a reflex  laila opened her eyes to see the snake whimpering in pain  she was shocked  how did i do that  laila thought in bewilderment  she looked around her and noticed a cockroach climbing a tree branch  she tried the same thing again  a handful of mauve lightning formed around her hands and hit the cockroach  it fell to the ground  whimpering just like the snake 

 laila was shocked  the ritual had worked  she couldn t believe it  she d consumed all the witch s powers and turned into one herself  much stronger than anticipated 
          
laila never went home  she d waited months to confront armaan  she d been practicing her magic and learned to control her reflexes  but somehow her powers continued to control her body  her emotions were out of control  she felt violent  her powers were starting to consume her  laila wasn t sure exactly what went wrong with the witch s ritual  but it had definitely resulted in the buildup of extreme and unimaginable anger inside of her  she d forgotten what it was like to smile  to be happy  to love  she was as vengeful as ever  all she wanted was to curse armaan and rukhsaar with a miserable life 
laila waited for it to get dark to enter armaan s house  she passed a wift of drugged air towards the guards who soon fell asleep  she pushed the gate open and made her way in  armaan was resting outside in the veranda smoking a cigar when he noticed laila walking towards him 
armaan couldn t believe his eyes   laila  is that really you   he jumped from the chair and started running towards her  as he got closer  he noticed laila s eyes were red  she was sweating  her hair was all over the place  she looked miserable 

  we ve been worried sick  we even went to the police  your mother s been crying her eyes out   and poor ramu  he s fallen ill  laila   rukhsaar came running outside as she saw laila staring at armaan   what s wrong  why aren t you saying anything   
 you betrayed me  armaan   laila said in a slow  hoarse voice  her eyes half open 
 laila  i don t understand why you keep saying that  that s the last thing you said to me at the bakery before you ran off without any explanations  why don t you calm down and we can talk about it  but please first sit down and drink some water  
 you don t understand why    laila screamed  her voice echoed making the trees shake with full force  her eyes turning more red by the second 
 laila    
 i loved you  i cared for you  i had nobody except for you  you pretended to love me and then went and married this random girl from the streets     laila s rage made the entire house shudder 
armaan didn t know what to do  how to respond  he was petrified and trembling with fear  all he wanted was to save rukhsaar and the baby   laila please calm down  i beg you  you re out of control  
laila wasn t listening to a word armaan was saying  it all went over her head  her powers were starting to consume her again 
 laila please      rukhsaar begged holding laila s hand 

  youu   laila stared into rukhsaar s eyes   i curse you  
 no  laila  wait     armaan screamed 
    i curse you  you ll never be able to conceive again  you ll never bring a new life into this world  i curse you with infertility   a swirl of air surrounded rukhsaar and she fell to the ground  unconscious 
 no   armaan screamed and ran towards rukhsaar   you witchhh  what did i ever do to you  laila    armaan wept as he attempted to help rukhsaar regain consciousness 
laila progressed towards armaan  a bolt of lightning swirling around her hands  just as she was about to attack  she felt a salt like substance cut through her flesh like a knife  laila screamed and looked towards her left  it was mrs  chowdri  laila was furious  she advanced
towards mrs  chowdri only to have crystals of salt thrown straight at her face  her skin burnt and started to melt  she was starting to go out of control 
 ammi  how did you      
 armaan  run  don t worry about rukhsaar  run for your life  i can t stall her for much longer   mrs  chowdry attacked laila again  more skin burnt and fell to the ground 

           
armaan didn t know how long he d been running  laila had caught up to him twice but somehow he d managed to escape both times and run further ahead  but he knew she was somewhere behind him  and much faster  she had hurt his knee and he could feel the blood dripping down his leg  was she really capable of this 
armaan decided to sit by a tree branch to catch his breath  he didn t realize how tired he was  it was hot and his clothes were drenched in sweat  his knee was starting to swell  he almost dozed off when he saw black figure approaching him  it was her 
 hello  my love  you ve been such a tease   armaan couldn t absorb what laila had turned into  she smiled cunningly as she walked towards him 
 the salt crystals   they melted your skin     that means you re      armaan was unable to digest what he d just realized 
laila s rage subsumed into anguish   i never wanted to hurt you armaan  but you left me no choice  
armaan stared at her in disbelief  at his best friend 

  after all the times we spent together  all the wonderful memories we made  this is how you want to end things  laila   armaan s voice was starting to break   how did you become so hateful  
 how  you ask   laila questioned   you played with my feelings  you used me  you knew everything about me  yet you chose to abandon me for a stranger  
 laila  we were friends   arman wept   we were friends  we had a platonic bond  i never made any promises to you  we were never romantic  
laila had lost the ability to reason  to think rationally  armaan s words were upsetting her  her rage was coming back and she felt her head pounding with pain  her eyes becoming red and watery again 
 i curse you with banishment from mirapur  from your family  from rukhsaar    please  laila   armaan begged   this isn t you  don t do this  
 your wife will never birth a child again  your son will never know you   armaan wept and begged   i m sorry  laila  
laila smiled at his misery   i m sorry i didn t recognize your love  please let me return to my family  please  
 it s done  never step foot in mirapur again   or you ll be responsible for many deaths

 my armaan never came back   rukhsaar beghum was crying  she felt pain in her chest  her heart as heavy as ever 
neha s eyes were filled with tears  she couldn t bear to see her dadi like this  she had beencursed  cursed with infertility 
 mummy ji passed from trauma soon after  all i had was your father  i took over mummy ji s bakery and moved to a small house nearby  
 what about that witch laila   neha felt hatred build up inside her   did she ever appear again  
 once   rukhsaar beghum answered  as she managed to wipe her tears from her dupatta 
neha s eyes widened 
 your father was two years old  i was putting him to bed when i saw her red eyes glaring from outside the window  
 what did she want  
    to warn me that she d always have an eye on all my future generations  my son  his wife  his children    

 neha started to feel chills all over her body      and if i tried to leave this town  it wouldn t mean escape    
    i ve protected my family all my life  and i know if your wedding took place in mirapur  she d resurface   sadness could be felt in rukhsaar beghum s voice 
 how do you know that   neha was confused 
    because you re the first born of the third generation  and this is your biggest happiness  i m not taking any risks  
 but dadi    
 that s enough  neha  you wanted the whole story right  well  here it is  now  first thing tomorrow morning  we re leaving for karachi  
neha wondered what her grandparents  biggest crime was  that dada ji didn t love laila back  was that it  was that all this witch was mad about  loneliness was a dangerous thing
