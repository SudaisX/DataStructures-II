 are we killing him tonight  captain   aag  the fire ant  asked  her hands rubbed against mischief  her voice starved for blood  and her eyes frantically paced around 
 now  now  we have to make him lose his mind before we do anything   the captain justified his wait 
 he hasn t slept in a day  the mission has been going as planned  what are we waiting for  sir  
 i know you are hungry for revenge  but he doesn t seem to be dwelling in his utmost despair  look at him  
and so they all looked at musadiq khan 
musadiq  oblivious to his small enemies  fidgeted his tiny thumbs in agony  he twisted and turned in hopes of sleep  his eyes  half dozed but his body refused to be  this morning he had a mouthful of cheeni  was it finally getting to his brain  what was this sudden change  little did he know  he had guests staying over  underneath his mattress lay tiny fortresses built by mitti colony  they were the haunting reason behind this 11 year old boy s sleepless night  but mitti colony would defer  musadiq was no boy  he was a giant  a monster  always digging his hand  quite literally  into a dirty pool of ant blood  just one word from the captain and the army ants would rise to the forefront of this mattress to confront their one human enemy  musadiq 
huddled into the corner of this car sheeted mattress were mitti colony s finest leaders  every night  aag  captain chunti  and commander bullet decided whether it was time  whether today  captain would yell  mitta do   and perish musadiq s tyranny 
 commander bullet  what is your take on this   captain asked 
 the stakes aren t high enough  i think we should wait until tomorrow   the commander stared
at him  eyebrows in a furrow  how will you save yourself from this one  musadiq 
the dusk of the next day brought in the same discussion  musadiq was restless  and so
was aag  every second of the night felt like time slipping away 
 what about tonight  captain   aag repeated
 he seems out of breath  what do you think  commander  
 there is much despair left for him   the commander said 
 sir  with all due respect  if we don t attack now  he will forfeit into his parent s room  might i remind you  we cannot attack in front of witnesses  
 i think aag is right  the army ants have been pestering me for the same reasons  we should initiate plan a   captain agreed 
plan a  like b  and c were plotted before these estranged camp nights  what is the most gruesome way to kill musadiq  aag proposed scrumptious bites around the neck  she wanted his head to fall to the ground like trees do when axed  imagine his head victoriously standing outside their nest  her ancestors would be proud  but how do you cut his bone  miss aag

army ants jumped forward and revealed their secret weapon  stinging  a human is easy to bite  their skin is tempting  it s always begging to be tasted  they proposed stinging his eyes  nose  and scalp  but how many holes until he bleeds to death 
that s when captain suggested plan a  sneaking into his brain  where all his death plan existed  one by one  they would enter inside  from near his ear lobes  through his nostrils  down his throat  all tiny holes that invited intrusion  aag squealed in delight  plan a was the only water willing to salvage her thirst 
 why can t we forgive him   commander bullet interrupted 
aag fumed like the long lost cousin of a kettle whistling on a hot stove  she left her temper controls   are you forgetting what he did to our workers  he flooded our underground nest  we had to swim out with dead ant workers  i said dead   captain shivered as if shaking off the water his dead friends swam in  its wetness haunting him even on the driest of days 
mitti colony looked like a pile of dirt on the outside but inside it was an underground edifice for this ant scaled city  a happy ground for many  the finely structured specks of dirt aligned with each other to create a maze like tunnel  a delicate network of paths  all existed without a blueprint  never did they imagine water would crumble their home into a muddy deathbed  many homeless  many dead 
 did you forget what he did to army ants   aag reminded commander 
army ants live their entire lives serving their one true queen  like all colonies  mitti  colony had one too but musadiq had other plans  one unlucky evening  musadiq was sitting nearby  it so happened to be the day their queen took a stroll outside  he spotted the blossoming black creature amongst other mere inconveniences of a name for ants  the devil s advocate grabbed her from the abdomen  the part that hid all her eggs  the other hand picking on her legs  one by one he pulled them out  plucked and stretched  he threw them away like a pair of fallen eyelashes  when all six of her legs were homeless  he placed her body on top of the nest  circled by army ants  she died caressing each soldier with her antenna  avenge my death  her last words became their new purpose 
 do i need to remind you of my dear anjali   aag sat under a cloud of blackness 
one day  aag was venturing her way back with a piece of gulabjamun  she caught anjali  the heart throb of mitti colony  and heart stealer of many  walking into the kitchen  aag followed in hopes of impressing her with this sweet finding  but she dropped it at the horrible sight that followed  anjali became a captive of musadiq  she was trapped inside the boundaries of a transparent tumbler  then he walked her to the microwave and centered her on the heating plate  a few beeps and she was twirling in demonic heat waves  her screams droned against the hums of the microwave but her legs shook mid air  musadiq counted the last three seconds  right before it hit zero  anjali plopped into million black pieces  each one shrunken into wrinkles like chopped pieces of sundried tomato 
 i remember all of it very well  i think i am still grieving the death of my sister  perhaps  we should wait until we have all done justice to our grief   commander finally spoke

 i am sorry for your loss  brother   the captain said and walked up to commander  he touched his antennas as a gesture of love  the minute their antenna came in contact  the captain knew something was wrong  he jabbed the commander against the bedsheet 
 who are you  reveal yourself   he asked with his sting inches away 
aag watched in confusion  she took a step closer and brushed her antenna against commanders  she scented intrusion 
 kill him  captain  he isn t from here   aag backed away   they  said the con 
 they what  
 i am not a male specie  i am a shape shifting creature  i am neither a living mortal nor a senseless jinn  i cannot be killed  if you would let me free  captain  i can explain much better   the captain lowered his sting 
 i am a hamzad of musadiq  
 a hamzad  i know of you  you are the evil twin of humans  you are made of his sins  aren t you   aag interrupted 
 oh dear  you believe that nonsense  i am sick of this ill rumor  no  i am the guardian angel of this little boy  i am here to protect him  
 even after all he has done to us  
 granted he is evil  that he has spewed mischief around  after 1000 years of protecting humans  he is the first i want to disband but i cannot or i will perish  besides no one wants to replace me  this task is a nightmare   hamzad pleaded on behalf of musadiq  despite the troubles he brought  musadiq  the idiot  thought of himself as a god 
the first time hamzad received their file  they cheered  like all their other tasks  they were giddy to have a little boy to look after  alas it was short lived  when a mortal human thinks of himself as a god  courage becomes his spine  he jumped off rooftops  swished knives around as if it was nothing  played with boiling water  jump scared animals  and walked off into place prone to jinns  unaware that it was his hamzad sliding the gutter cap when he was 10 years old  his hamzad who had halted animals from killing him so far  and now it was his hamzad who tried to convince the ants otherwise 
 give him a chance  he is just a boy  
 he isn t helping you with your case   captain pointed at musadiq  who was now circling one of the wall ants with ink  laughing as the ant anxiously tried to break out of this tortured cell 
 he is a hopeless idiot  i will not stop you from haunting him  but these sleepless nights will kill him  let him be  maybe he will change   pleaded hamzad 
 and why should we do you this favor   the captain argued

 if you let him be  i will transfer you to a place you can call heaven  the army ants can have a new queen to please  haunt him tonight and then live a life of pleasure  
the captain and hamzad shook hands 
 no no no  captain  i will not leave until i avenge anjali s death  haunting doesn t do her death justice   aag intervened 
the hamzad paused and thought 
 i might have a solution for you   they smirked 
 
 mitta do  captain commanded 
out crawled the group of soldiers  raiding his room  musadiq noticed a group of ants tumbling in the corner  before he knew it  they morphed into ant man  they bridged onto one another and hovered over him like a skyscraper  with all ants moving inside  ant man looked like snow and white static on a tv screen  his eyes widened in disbelief  he stumbled over his chair and fell on the ground 
 it s time for you to pay   the ant man said   y you can t kill me  
the ant man dispersed into groups and jumped onto musadiq  they crawled over his body as he screamed in agony  the creeping crawlers tingled down his spine  he screamed at first but closed it shut when they flew on to his tongue  muffled in pain  his eyes became teary  he lay powerless and his body  too weak to fight  musadiq fainted in the middle of chaos 
when his mother found him knocked out on the floor  it was nothing out of the ordinary  he wiped his hands all over his body  he checked for any crawlers and questioned with all his might  what happened to the ants  was the visit even real  he believed it wasn t  he was a god after all  and so continued the reign of musadiq  the immortal king  he tried poking his hand under a lit stove and crashed his body on to doors  he was back on track  until one day  he encountered another ant  how long had it been since he saw an ant  the old ones had vanished after that night  mitti colony was long gone  none hid behind doors  nor walked inside his kitchen floors  it was as if all the ants in his world were disposed of  he missed ants so he picked up this one  closely examining  he noticed it was blue  translucent  and squishy between his fingers  it felt gooey  fun  but soon his fascination drenched into fear  the blue ant crawled up to his ear and whispered 
 child  you are a disaster  mess with anything again and the ants will haunt you   he remembered the ant man  was this ant talking about   
 if you don t think about your mortal actions  your time to pay will come

he shivered again  who was this 
 i am your new hamzad  the old one guarded you against danger until they got sick of your naivety and handed me your address but fear not  i am not new at all  we have met before  you and i  near the microwave  you and i  when i climbed over your spine  you and i  met over plan a  i was a fire ant before i became blue like water  
a hamzad  what is this voice talking about  he still had powers  right  gods cannot be killed   do as you are told  and no one will devour your existence  
he tried to scratch his ear off  and plunge out this talking voice  he tried everything until he slumped himself against the wall 
 this is my home now  i will not leave  
shut up  he slapped his head 
 don t fret on this  child  i will only speak when you do something bad indeed   the voice went silent afterward 
every morning  musadiq poured water down his ear  his head tilted to the side for 5 minutes  he drained  cleansed  rinsed  and sometimes placed drops of medication but the blue ant never came out  only when he forgot about all of it and began his mischiefs  the voice slithered in like a snake  soon he accepted defeat  he let things be  for if he didn t  the voice would drill in and steer  he never batted an eye at ants  never crossed a soul  and never walked in on the tempted thoughts of torture  he only lived a life  he was meant to seek
